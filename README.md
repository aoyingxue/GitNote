# cp_GitNote

updated on August 4, 2019.
I put my study markdown notes pushed onto here to sync with different systems and computers. 
I used a few different types of markdown softwares such as gitnote, typora.
gitnote has a few syncing and signing in problems so i chose to use typora on my mac.
but gitnote seems fine working on linux.
