# GitNote

I used a few different types of markdown softwares such as gitnote, typora.
Gitnote has a few syncing and signing in problems, so I chose to use typora on my mac.
But gitnote seems fine working on linux.

If LaTex is needed, you could install a chrome extension called "MathJax Plugin for Github" for previewing the LaTex equations.
