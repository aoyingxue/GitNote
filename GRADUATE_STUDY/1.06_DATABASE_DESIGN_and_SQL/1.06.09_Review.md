1. Self-join to list **pair** 

   Remember p1.company<p2.company to eliminate the repeated ones

   > Please list pair of companies attending All Campus career fair.

   ```sql
   select p1.company,p1.careerfair,p2.company
   from attendance as p1 join attendance as p2 
   where p1.careerfair=p2.careerfair and p1.careerfair='all campus' and p1.company<p2.company;
   ```

   > Find all pairs of customer that have the same address. Include the address in your answer.

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT C1.CustomerName, C2.CustomerName, Address
   FROM Customers as C1 JOIN Customers as C2 USING(Address) 
   WHERE C1.CustomerName < C2.CustomerName
   ORDER BY C1.CustomerName, C2.CustomerName, Address;
   ```

2. 一般计算的时候**用key去count**而不用其他，防止有**null**的情况; SELECT **COUNT** (**DISTINCT** productVendor) 只计算不重复的数量
