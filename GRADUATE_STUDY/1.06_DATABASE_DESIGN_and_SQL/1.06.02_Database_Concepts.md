1. Transaction systems vs **Data warehouse**
2. **Logical perspective** vs Physical perspective
3. Uses and **users** of data

### Rule #1 Logical and physical data independence

- **Data independence**

  - Change the **schema** at one level of the database system without changing higher level schemas

- **Logical data independence** 

  - Change the conceptual schema without changing **user views**
  - Allows adding fields, unique to some users
    - **Not** done frequently. Why not?
      - When adding these fields, you can cause confusion and especially confusion across tables. 
      - if you wrote a SQL query across two tables it reflected the names of the fields that were in the tables at that time. But now when you add a new field to one of the tables and it happens to coincide or have the exact same names as the different field in a different table. Then you get contradictions in your SQL queries won't run or won't run correctly.

- **Physical data independence**

  - Change the internal schema without having to change the conceptual schema or user views

    - For example: use different software on the same database 

      - ERP (企业资源计划), CRM ([客户关系管理](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/客户关系管理)), Tableau, reports, dashboards, transactions

### Database Management System (DBMS)

#### 1. Concept

**Software system** to define, create, maintain, and provide controlled access to the database and to repository

#### 2. **Repository AKA** ***Data Dictionary***

- Store **metadata** for a the database

- Includes information on relationships between files or tables in a particular database

#### 3. Metadata

- Characteristics of files or relations
  - **Tables**: names, content, notes, etc
  - Relationships **between** tables: keys, triggers, indexes
- Data about data (each table)
  - All of the characteristics *describing the attributes* of an entity, examples:
    - Name
    - Data type (numeric/alphanumeric)
    - Size (length)
    - **Format** or special characteristics

#### 4. Summary

- Databases are essential to all business

- Our role is primarily focused on *extracting data*

- Relational databases allow us to separate the physical level *(Comp. Sci.)* and logical level *(analyst)* 

- Many benefits to relational databases

- Need to learn the key tool to extracting data: *SQL*
