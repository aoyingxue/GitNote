## I. Purpose of E/R Model

- The E/R model allows us to <u>draw</u> database*schemas*.
  - Includes some constraints, but not operations (actions).

- Designs are pictures called *entity-relationship diagrams*.

- *Later*: convert E/R diagram to a relational database.

- Why use diagrams?
  - An easy way to communicate. Conveys a message more effectively than a lot of text.
  - An opportunity to ask questions of the database and see if the way we're modeling the database is convenient to answer all those questions
    - Sometimes modify the diagram to answer certain questions
    - One diagram might answer certain questions but if you want to ask different questions you need to design a database differently 

Example: Dillard's 

![image-20190825170607412](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825170607412.png)

- Store: primary key
- MSA: metropolitan statistical area, info at the aggregate (总数) level
- SKUINFO: stock keeping unit (stock is the primary key)
- Why separate DEPT from SKU? **to save space**
  - The department description takes space and it might be a longer name
  - If they had combined these two tables, they would have had this department description listed for every SKU. 
- SKSTINFO: 
  - the SKU information store information
  - the cost of getting that product to that store
  - the retail price
    - view the retail price and the cost as **separate by store**
- TRANSACT:
  - how many different items
  - how many different transactions 
  - what sort of questions you could ask
    - income over here to average transaction amount 
    - the relationship between the original price and the retail price
    - how does the retail price vary by different regions of the country geographically or by income levels 
    - If certain products more popular in certain regions
    - If certain departments more popular in certain regions
- there are questions you can't answer from the database
  - at the transaction level I don't think we have the salesperson that  specifically made the sale 
  - Don't have employee information

## II. WHY A DATABASE?

### 1. Why organize a database?

- Why not just one long spreadsheet?
  - Advantages: 
    - See all data in one place; scroll around the data; zoom in and out to whatever data I want to see; focus on what's interesting
    - Easy to transfer from one person to the next
  - **Disadvantages**: 
    - Create an unnecessarily **large** file: Dataset could get really big;  file may be too large to send it to others; excel may not be able to process
    - **Wasteful** of memory: Repeat a lot of information
    - Data entry **mistakes**: Can cause mistakes when entering the data; different people have different product descriptions; might take a typo when typing in 
    - **Null** values
    - **Incorrect calculations**: got repeated data and unaware of which data is repeated, so incorrect conclusions when aggregating certain columns
  - SO separate our data into multiple tables
  - What we need: data not repeated and not wasting space and information (*database design* perspective); but in one place to be able to relate (*analyst* perspective)
    - Data in disparate tables divided up many times
    - Aggregate the data to create the reports relating data from one table to another
    - Write SQL code to get the data from different tables into one table and present analysis

> MSRP=suggested retail price

### 2. 2 principles behind organizing data

1. Every piece of data is stored only **once** 

2. If a field has many ***null*** values, it may be better to take that field out and store it **separately**

   ​	to have a much more concise and smaller table of values

## III. ENTITY SETS

- ***Entity*** = “thing” or object.
  - ER图的实体（entity）即数据模型中的数据对象，例如人、学生、音乐都可以作为一个数据对象，用长方体来表示，每个实体都有自己的实体成员（entity member）或者说实体对象（entity instance），例如学生实体里包括张三、李四等，实体成员（entity member）/实体实例（entity instance） 不需要出现在ER图中。
- ***Entity set*** = **collection** of similar entities.
  - Similar to a **class** in object-oriented languages.
- ***Attribute*** = property of (the entities of) an entity set.
  - Attributes are **simple** values, e.g. integers or character strings, not structures, sets, etc.
  - Restricted to a **single value** (number or text)
    - Cannot be further divided, like address/ name
    - May have ***null*** values
  - *Later:* what about complex attributes (e.g. addresses)?
  - **ER图的属性（attribute）**即数据对象所具有的属性，例如学生具有姓名、学号、年级等属性，用椭圆形表示，属性分为唯一属性（ unique attribute）和非唯一属性，唯一属性指的是唯一可用来标识该实体实例或者成员的属性，用下划线表示，一般来讲实体都至少有一个唯一属性。
- ***Tuple*** = an individual item within a set （元祖）
  - In this case, an Entity within and Entity set

## IV. E/R Diagrams

- In an entity-relationship diagram:

  - Entity set = rectangle

  - Attribute = oval, with a line to the rectangle representing its entity set

  - ![image-20190825181907570](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825181907570.png)

  - For example:

    - Entity set: *Students* has two attributes, name and program (e.g., MS/Analytics, MS/SCM, MBA, etc.).

      - Entity Set should be in **plural**

    - Each entity in *Students* has **values** for each attribute, e.g., John, MS/SCM

      - **Null** values are allowed for some attributes
      - **Primary key** **cannot** have Null values

      ![image-20190825183431638](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825183431638.png)

![image-20190825183732774](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825183732774.png)

## V. DATABASE CONCEPTS CONT.

### 1. Relationships

- A ***relationship*** connects two or more entity sets.

- Represented by a diamond, with lines to each of the entity sets involved.

- **ER图的关系（relationship）**用来表现数据对象与数据对象之间的联系，例如学生的实体和成绩表的实体之间有一定的联系，每个学生都有自己的成绩表，这就是一种关系，关系用菱形来表示。

- ![image-20190825183943200](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825183943200.png)

- What sort of questions (queries/reports) could we ask from this database?

  *How many students are enrolled in each program?*

  *How many students are enrolled in each course?*

  *list of enrolled students in a specific course*

  - Which attributes could we add to each Entity Set?

    *faculty member teaching a course*

    *Student phone number/address*

    *how many students have completed the prerequisites for a certain course*

    *how many credits each student is completed by aggregating over the number of credits and courses that they've already taken*

  - When does an **attribute become an Entity Set**?

    - *An attribute on an attribute* : *where they took prerequisite*
    - *When the current diagram doesn't allow us to answer a specific question* 
      - What is the average class size for students in the SMP program? 
        - You need to have a new entity set that relates the SMP program to the different degrees that are given within the SMP

### 2. Entity and Relationship Sets

- The current “value” of an ***entity set*** is the set of entities that belong to it.
  - Example: the set of all students in our database.
- The “value” of a relationship is a ***relationship set*,** a set of tuples with one component for each related entity set.
  - Doesn't exist on its own. Have to borrow an attribute from the connected entities to identify the entities

### 3. Subclasses

- subclasses = special use = fewer entities = more expertises
- Example: box tickets are a type of ticket
  - Not every seat (ticket) is an box seat, but some are
  - In addition to all the properties (attributes and relationships) of tickets, box tickets also have the attribute meal
- Assume subclasses form a tree

  

## VI. Multiway relationships

- Sometimes, we need a relationship that connects more than two entity sets.
- In defining a student’s enrollment in a course, we should also specify the semester.
  - Use a **3-way relationship**
  - ![image-20190825185547484](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825185547484.png)
  - ![image-20190825185634854](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825185634854.png)
- Similarly, use ***n*****-way relationships**.

## VII. Cardinality of Relationships

#### Many-many relationships

- Focus on *Entity Sets* 
  - Binary *relationships*, such as *Enroll in* between Students and Courses.
- In a ***many-many* relationship**, an entity of either set can be connected to many entities of the other set.
  - E.g., a student enrolls in many courses; many students enroll in the same course.
  - **Many = any number greater than 1**(not 0, not 1)
  - ![image-20190825190824645](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825190824645.png)

#### Many-one relationships

- Some binary relationships are *many*–*one*.
- Each entity of the first set is connected to ***at most*** one entity of the second set.
- But, an entity of the second set can be connected to zero, one, or many entities of the first set.
  - Example: Students and Programs.
  - Many students are in the same program, but a student may be in at most one program (assume).
    - Now we expanded Programs into an Entity Set, with Students *Registered for* Programs.

#### One-one relationships

- In a one-one relationship, each entity of either entity set is related to ***at most one*** entity of the other set.
- ![image-20190825212236820](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825212236820.png)

#### Representing cardinality

> Cardinality defines the numeric relationships between occurrences of the entities on either end of the relationship line.

- **Many-many** relationship = straight line
- Show a **many-one** relationship by an arrow entering the “one” side.
  - ![image-20190825214847749](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825214847749.png)
- Show a **one-one** relationship by arrows entering both entity sets.
- Rounded arrow = “**exactly one**,” i.e., each entity of the first set is related to exactly one entity of the target set.
  - ![image-20190825214833467](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825214833467.png)
- **Notes:**
  - An entity’s cardinality represents the maximum number of one type that can be associated with a corresponding entity
  - You may also want to represent the *minimum* number of each entity

![image-20190825214507736](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825214507736.png)

![image-20190825215010844](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825215010844.png)

0=empty; 

#### Cardinality – Exercise

For each of these, decide the type of relationship (**1:1**,**1:M**, **M:1**, **M:M**)

- Student **has an** academic advisor *M:1*
- Advisor **works with** degree programs *1:1 or 1:M or M:1 or M:M*
- Student **has a** car *1:1*
- Student **buys** textbooks *1:M* 

## VIII. Attributes on Relationships 

- We may want to attach an <u>attribute to a relationship</u>.
- This attribute is a property (only) of <u>tuples in the relationship set</u>.
  - *Example: Enrollment date, Grade*
  - ![image-20190825215654618](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825215654618.png)
    - Depend on the attributes of both students and courses

## IX. Keys in E/R Diagrams

#### CONCEPT

- A ***key*** is an attribute, or a set of attributes, for the entity set such that *<u>no two entities</u>* in this set *<u>agree on all attributes</u>* of the key.
  - It is allowed for two entities to agree on some (but not all) of the key attributes.
    - To ensure the uniqueness of each tuple in the table
  - The key **cannot** be **NULL**
- We ***must designate a key for every entity set***.
- <u>**Underline** the key attribute(s).</u>
- Later: In an Isa hierarchy, only the root entity set has a key, and it must serve as the key for all entities in the hierarchy.
- A multi-attribute Key
  - ![image-20190825220652599](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825220652599.png)
  - OMM 559 is not the same as MGT 559. (DEPT+NO.)
  - Note that time and room could also serve as a key; we must select **only one key**. 
    - It means if you choose time + room, when you assign a time for a course, you have to decide which room at the same time. It may restrain you. 
- ![image-20190825221507062](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825221507062.png)

## X. Tables

#### From E/R Diagrams to *Relations*

- An *Entity set* becomes a *relation* (table).
  - Attributes become attributes.
- *Relationships* become *relations* whose attributes are only:
  - **The keys of the connected entity sets**.
    - To identify the appropriate relations (sID )
      - In M:1, you may need only one foreign key to become the primary key to identify the relationships
      - In M:M, you need both foreign keys to uniquely define a row in the relationship
      - In M:**exactly 1**, you don't convert it to relations
  - Attributes of the relationship itself
- Specifically, the primary keys of the Entity Sets become foreign keys for the relation.
  - *These foreign keys are the primary key of the relation*
  - Likely to use <u>multi-attribute</u> keys
- ![image-20190825222433831](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825222433831.png)

  - Program只需要sid因为学生一定会register一个program的
- ![image-20190825223640315](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825223640315.png)

## XI. Multivalued Attributes

![image-20190825223833064](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825223833064.png)

#### Multivalued attributes in E/R

- An attribute may have multiple values
  - **Double circle**
  - ![image-20190825224242612](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825224242612.png)
- Cardinals’ Customers have a history of “past purchases”
  - Multiple values for each customer
  - Why keep track of this information?
    - We can know John is a loyal customer or an opportunistic customer
- Why not just use one table?
  - Redundant information of other attributes

#### Multivalued attributes to Relations

- Create 2 relations 
- The second relation has 2 attributes
  - The primary key of the 1st relation, which is a foreign key here
  - And values for the multivalued attribute
  - **Both attributes**, together, are the **key** of the **second** relation
    - Name is a foreign key
  - ![image-20190825224600608](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825224600608.png)

#### Multivalued attributes: Equivalency

![image-20190825224825902](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190825224825902.png)

Have: "M:exactly 1", no need to convert

## Summary

- A first step in designing a database is developing E/R diagrams
-  These are not as simple as they seem.
  - The appropriate diagram depends on the implementation
  - Business application drives E/R diagrams
  - What if business needs change in the future?
- E/R diagrams will be converted into *Relations*(tables)

- Entities (tuples) are rows of the tables
- Use keys to uniquely identify rows in a table
  - Constraints you put in today may not be important in the future
- Use foreign keys to relate relations
