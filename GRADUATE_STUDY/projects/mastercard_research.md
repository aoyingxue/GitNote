### Main Objectives: 

**Present a change management plan to implement and drive adoption of a Talent, skills based, Marketplace.** 

#### 1. What behaviors did you discover were common across businesses that adopted a Talent, skills based, Marketplace? i.e., What behaviors drive a culture of continuous learning?

- <u>Customer-focused</u> brand image (understand employees' needs and be ahead of the curve) *(visa case)*
  - Subject matter expert and employee interviewing, prototyping, and constant iteration allowing them to rapidly launch new and effective content
- Challenges and innovations
- Teaching culture (lectures or practices shared by executives or leaders)
- Data-driven digital-based workplace

#### 2. What do we need to do culturally, to make this happen? (e.g., a traditional culture (hierarchical, roles based) to a more agile, skills based, project focused‚Ä¶e.g., Mastercard vs. Twitter/Google)

##### Robust continuous **learning** culture *(visa case)*

- Confidently think, act, and perform in a digital environment that is <u>transforming daily</u>

  - Create an <u>open opportunity</u> culture
  - <u>Share experiences and **best practices**</u> across the organization

#### 3. What technologies do you suggest we enable to support the transition and implementation of a Talent, skills based, Marketplace? e.g., Degreed Skills Rating, assessment, chatbots, AI technology‚Ä¶

##### (ùüô). *AI Recommendation* System

Use <u>Artificial Intelligence</u> to identify highly personalized open opportunities across the company for each employee in real time based on their unique skills, experiences, and ambitions. *(Schneider <u>Gloat</u> Open Talent Market case)* 

- **AI learns each individual‚Äôs unique professional profile and pairs it with the full spectrum of opportunities** be they part-time projects, full-time positions, or mentorships available across the organization.

##### (ùüö). In-person(**physical**) and online(**digital**) **curriculum** *(corporate university like Visa University)*

https://elearningindustry.com/the-20-best-learning-management-systems

- **Functions**: 

  https://scorm.com/learning-record-store-vs-learning-management-system/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=natural_search

  - Control course‚Äôs setup, delivery and learner progress tracking
  - Manage users, roles, instructors, facilities
  - Chat rooms
  - Podcasting
  - Video conferencing

- **Types**:

  - Cloud-based LMS
    - faster deployment
    - hosted on the provider's server, offering data security and maintenance by the provider. 
    - user-friendly and avoid IT hustle
    - Automatic software updates 
  - Open-source LMS
    - budget-friendly
    - installed on the company's server
    - handle updates manually
    - limited features and courses
  
- **Accessibility**

  LMS allows trainees to access their courses and lessons anywhere at any time. Since these courses are offered online, trainees can access them at their own convenience. This reduces the pressure of having to coordinate and fix timings, dates, and venues of in-person training. Due to an LMS, multiple employees can receive training simultaneously without having to face any time difference or travel challenges. This feature is particularly beneficial for global offices.

- **Cost Saving**

  An organization‚Äôs training budget can be greatly reduced by using an LMS for training its employees. Learning Management Systems will save an organization money on trainers, training venue, stationery, travel costs, etc. All the money that used to be spent on training its employees can now be used for other initiatives or be added to the profits of an organization.

  Sometimes due to the high costs of training employees, organizations skip on the training which will not help the employee reach his/her full potential at work. Training is extremely important for higher productivity and now with LMS, it is affordable.

- **Track Progress**

  An LMS software tracks each student‚Äôs progress, evaluates results, and analyzes their track record for the benefit of management. LMS sends progress and evaluation reports to management to keep them up to date with their employees‚Äô training. This feature of LMS helps management identify good talent, provide them with further training to enhance their skills, and also helps in making promotion decisions.

  Evaluation reports also enable management to intervene if they want to give some feedback to a trainee or help them out with their lessons or courses.

- **Manage Courses**

  LMS gives the management complete control over the courses offered and allows them to edit or change the courses whenever they want. This enables management to add or subtract courses depending on what they want to teach their employees. Management can alter their courses as per the employee‚Äôs progress and training evaluation. They can add certain courses that they feel might be more beneficial to an employee or they can add sub-courses for a more detailed training in a course.

- **Lower Employee Attrition Rate**

  Research has shown that employees are more likely to resign and leave a company if they do not receive any training or learning in the company. Providing employees with training and ensuring that they get a chance to [learn and grow in the organization](https://thebossmagazine.com/steering-top-employees-success/), is going to bring down the employee attrition rate. Less employees will quit an organisation if they know that they have a scope of learning here.

##### (ùüù). Learning record store (LRS)  *(visa case study)*

https://xapi.com/learning-record-store/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=natural_search

- stores learning records, allows reporting against the records, and allows for exporting of raw learning data
- allow the [Experience API](https://xapi.com/) (xAPI) to offer a lot of new capabilities

> An LRS enables [modern tracking](https://xapi.com/layer-1-freeing-us-from-the-constructs-of-old/) of a wide [variety of learning experiences](https://xapi.com/layer-2-record-any-learning-experience-informal-learning/), which might include capturing real world activities, actions completed in mobile apps or even job performance. Data from these experiences is stored in the LRS and [can be shared](https://xapi.com/layer-3-free-the-data/) with other systems that offer advanced reporting or support adaptive learning experiences.

##### (ùüü). Distance learning technology combining digital and physical campuses

- Classrooms have video recording and live broadcast capability
- Broadcast available on replay in the digital campus
- in-person programs have related assets on the digital campus

#### 4. Think about creating personas, based on existing key roles that bring your change management plan to life. i.e., When we hire for Sales, what are the skills we look for? If we need a technologist, what skills do we need to look for?

digital and leadership skills

### Employee Retention is Becoming one of the biggest concerns of HR

- High turnover rate in society

  - In its 2018 Employee Tenure Summary, the BLS reported, the median employee tenure was 4.3 years for men and 4.0 years for women.
  - CNN money said that the average person will have 4 jobs by the time he or she is 32 years old.
  - Retention Report in 2019
    - https://info.workinstitute.com/hubfs/2019%20Retention%20Report/Work%20Institute%202019%20Retention%20Report%20final-1.pdf

- Costly to replace an employee

  - In 2016, Kimmel and Associations reported that A [calculation method](http://www.cepr.net/calculators/turnover_calc.html) developed by David Rosnick from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, imparts the cost to replace an employee making \$100,000, with factors such as job learning curve, job search HR costs, and advertising, can be closer to \$50,000 and not the typical 20% previously thought of as the standard.  (Kimmel and Associates. Employee retention and statistics. https://kimmel.com/employers/employee-retention-statistics.html/.)

### Reasons Why a Learning Platform Increases Employee Retention

- **maximizes company culture** 
  - Company culture plays a significant role in employee retention and turnover. The Infographic *The Statistical Case for Company Culture*4 stated, ‚ÄúA Columbia University study shows that the likelihood of job turnover at an organization with high company culture is a mere 13.9 percent, whereas the probability of job turnover in low company cultures is 48.4 percent.‚Äù Read about how an LMS maximizes company culture and thus increases employee satisfaction in our blog article [*How to Quickly Transform Your Company‚Äôs Culture with an LMS*](https://www.topyx.com/lms-blog/transform-company-culture-with-an-lms).

- **engages employees in training** 
  - Training is often not the most exciting aspect of an employee‚Äôs work experience. An LMS can elevate the training experience to one that is more engaging, and quality training can encourage employee retention. First, an LMS enables leaders to design effective content that includes audio, video, games, and simulations. Second, an eLearning system itself is an engaging vehicle of delivery for training content, allowing employees to have constant, convenient access to training through a feature called [mobile learning](https://www.topyx.com/lms-features/mobile-learning/).  

- **equips employees with skills that ensure job competence** 
  - Depending upon his or her job, an employee needs to possess specific skills, both technical and non-technical, in order to be competent at work. An individual who feels confident in his or her position may be more likely to remain loyal to an employer. Delivering regular training via LMS is a surefire way to impart both hard and [soft skills](https://www.topyx.com/lms-blog/elearning-roi-soft-skills) that can ensure job competence and possibly decrease employee turnover.
