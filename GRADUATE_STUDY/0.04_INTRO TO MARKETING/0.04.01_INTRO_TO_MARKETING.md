## I. Building Strong Brands

### 1. MARKETING different from EXCHANGE

1. Marketing is the studies of a market. 
2. A market is an **<u>exchange</u>** between two partners, frequently a *buyer* and a *seller*, 
but marketing also, applies to *non-profit* or things where there isn't necessarily money being transacted.
3. What is a basic EXCHANGE?
One buyer - one seller

### 2. 2 different kinds of market:

1. **Seller's Market**: 
  1. seller has a product; buyer comes to the seller
  2. focus on the product, on what the customer does well, and you push that out. 
  3. **Product Focus Market**: develop to the best of your ability; innovate; cost↓
2. **Buyer's Market**: 
   1. many competition among products; buyer has the power
   2. focus on the customer, what the customer wants. And you deliver value to the customer better than the competition.

### 3. CONNECTED COMMUNITY

1. marketer has to be completely **transparent**, has to be **authentic**, and has to focus on the entire **customer experience**.

2. **ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY**: marketing now has to focus on **authentic**, **genuine** customer value.

### 4. 3 Principles of Marketing

- Principle of Customer Value
- Principle of Differentiation
- Principle of Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning 

### 5. 4P's of Marketing

- PRODUCT: what the seller puts into the exchange
- PLACE: the way the seller delivers the product to the customer (the method of distribution)
- PROMOTION: the way the seller communicates the benefits about the product to the buyer
- PRICE: what the buyer puts into the exchange
- Applicable to nonprofit marketing as well
- For example: high school blood donations: blood=price; miss class=product; blood mobile=place

## II. Strategic Marketing

### 1. Market-Driven Principles

- Know your markets: most are customer-focused market; find a way to provide customer value better than the competition (Principle of Differentiation)
- Customer has the final say (assumption): 3 BUNDLES
  - Operations factors: price, cost, delivery, service, reliability, ...
  - Product features and designs: product attributes, design, innovation, technology
  - Customized to meet my needs?
  - Only pick something not that bad, as long as one is the best, the other two are good enough
- Be the best at something and good enough at the other two things

  - Offer fair value on 2 of bundles but offer something better than fair value on one of the bundles
  - Fair value line: constantly changing, not static

### 2. Strategies for leadership

  - Not have to be symmetric
  - How to use the framework:
    - Figure out 3 dimensions:
      - What are the product attributes that relate to the operational excellence?
      - What are the product attributes that matter to the customer?
      - How much customization is there in your market?
    - Anticipate what fair value is:
      - Where is the reference point? 
      - Where is the fair value line on each of these axis points?
        - The average of what everybody offers / nobody offers / everybody's above  
    - Plot where your company is delivering
    - Where your competition is on each of these axis
  - Look for a long term strategy & short term strategy
    - Long term strategy = be the best at 1 dimension and good enough on the other 2

## III. Segmentation and Targeting

![image-20190813194953276](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190813194953276.png)

### 1. STP framework

​	Segmentation - Targeting - Positioning

### 2. Why is STP important?

##### 	1. Segmentation 

- If you don't, you tend to reduce cost and go to the average value and not meeting anybody's needs 
- To give you exactly what you want - segment - heterogeneity or differences in preferences - choose or target which segment to deliver

###### 	i. CONCEPT:

- The process of dividing up the into distinct subsets, where any subset could conceivably be selected as a marketing target to be reached with a distinct marketing mix (4P's).

######     ii. HOW TO SEGMENT? Variables?

- Characteristics of the customer (m/f; city/country)
- Benefits that people seek (different things ppl seek)
- How to purchase (online, phones, physical, once a year, switch around/ loyal)
- Examples:
  - **Cohort analysis**: generation
    - ![image-20190813203826669](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190813203826669.png)
    - ![image-20190813203931805](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190813203931805.png)
    - The time when ppl come to age, in college because you make purchases at this age and then you're loyal to those brands over time.
    - Gen Y is different:
      - Brought up by computer
      - Free content
      - Social environment
      - Custom ed to Customization 
      - Not like mass marketing
    - ![image-20190813204400267](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190813204400267.png)
  - **Geographic** :
    - Regional segmentation
    - Zip clustering
      - PRIZM
    - People who are similar tend to live in neighborhoods that are similar.
    - where you live physically also affects your online behavior

##### 2. Select a Target Segment

- What makes a segment attractive?
- Balancing segment attractiveness with our capability
- Continuously monitoring whether the actual buyers match the target segment

###### Segment selection criteria

[^2 criteria]: **Segment Attractiveness & Competitive Strength**

- **Segment** size
- Growth of segment
- Value of segment ($)
- stability

---------------------------------

- Current company position within segment
- Ease of **entry** into segment (how easy to address the needs)

---------

- Ease of competitive entry into segment

- Number and strength of **competitors**

> Upon what basis do you think companies should divide a market into segments?
>
> - [ ] Demographics / characteristics of the customer
>
> - [ ] Product benefits sought by the customer

## IV. Brand Positioning

### 1. What is a BRAND?

- ##### A proprietary **trademark** for a specific product or service

- A **contract** from the company to its customers; a **promise** of specific benefits, quality, and value; a **relationship**

- Whatever the **customers** **think** it is

### 2. Positioning Statement

- #### A positioning statement defines the value proposition of product to the target market.

  - ##### Target segment (for whom)

  - ##### Point of difference (Reasons to buy)

    <!--Innovative-->

  - ##### Frame of reference (frame of reference)

    <!--Other personal computers-->

  > According to Apple's positioning statement, what is its point of difference?![img](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/marketing/Apple_statement.PNG)
  > - [x] It is innovative.
  > - [ ] It targets students.
  > - [ ] Its logo (an apple).
  > - [ ] Personal computing experiences.

- #### Positioning is implemented through all elements of the marketing mix: product, price, promotion, place.

- #### Should focus on a few key benefits (unique selling proposition)

- #### Position must be defensible.

- #### Positioning requires making choices.

- #### Point of Parity (POP)

  - Associations that are not unique to the brand; they are **shared** with other brands
  - **Category POPs**: associations consumer views as necessary to be considered credible
    - Ex: grocery store must have certain products (e.g., milk, eggs) to be truly considered a grocery store
  - **Competitive POPs**: associations designed to negate competitors' point of difference 
  - Ex: when APPLE changed its name from APPLE computer to APPLE, it changed its frame of reference. It's not just only computers. 

- #### Point of Difference (POD)

  - Strong, favorable, unique brand associations
  - Similar to notion of **USP** (unique selling proposition)
  - **SCA**: sustainable competitive advantage (achieve an advantage in the marketplace for a prolonged period of time)
  - May involve: performance attributes, benefits, imagery associations 

- #### POD Criteria

  - ##### Desirable to the customer?

    - Is POD relevant? 
      - Ex: consumers didn't care about clear cola, or "unbreakable chips"
    - Is POD distinctive?
      - Distinctive and superior

  - ##### Can you deliver the POD to the customer?

    - Feasibility 
      - Affordable? Possible? e.g., can airlines deliver on-time arrival?
    - communicability
      - Evidence to communicate?
    - Sustainability 
      - Internal commitment, difficult to attack; must be consistent at any point in time and over time
