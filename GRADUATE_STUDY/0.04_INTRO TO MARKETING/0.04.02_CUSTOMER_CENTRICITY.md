## I. From Product-Centric to Customer-Centric Management

### 1. STRATEGIES

**Performance superiority**: Best product (APPLE/ BMW/ Louis Vuitton/ Gucci)

**Operational excellence**: lowest price, most efficient operation or the most efficient experience for your customer (Walmart/ IKEA/ Zara)

**Customer intimacy**/ customer centricity

### 2. THE PRODUCT-CENTRIC APPROACH

> What do you think is the overall objective for most commercial enterprises?
>
> - [x] Maximize shareholder value
>
> - [ ] Maximize revenues
>
> - [ ] Expand to as many markets as possible

> **IT'S ALL ABOUT MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF THE WHOLE CORPORATION.**

- The goal of the firm is to **maximize shareholder value**

- Maximum profits through **volume and cost reductions**

> How do you think firms gauge their performance?
>
> - [x] **Volumes** that they're delivering
>
> - [x] Changes in **costs**
>
> - [x] **Market share**
>
> - [x] All of the above

- Key performance indicators such as **market share**
  - market share is not only a good backwards indicator of how well you've done, but a leading indicator of how well you will likely be doing in the future. 
- Growth through **extending the product**
- **Product-oriented** organizational structure
- The competitive advantage: **product expertise**
- **Source of growth**
  - Taking the great product or service and bringing it to new customers
  - Innovation

## II. Cracks in the Product-Centric Approach

- Technology-enabled product development ⇒ **commoditization** (商品化)

- Technology-enabled information flow ⇒ **smart customers**
- Technology-enabled delivery ⇒ **retail saturation**
  - No one had a product like them 
  - If other companies did have, customers won't be aware of it
  - Even if customers were aware of it, customer won't have access to it
- **Globalization** 
- **Deregulation** 
  - regulation was a way that gave companies monopoly power. That they were the only game in town and customers had no choice. 
  - But as one industry after another deregulates, companies need to be much more competitive. 
- Customers want "**end-to-end solutions,**" which may require products/ services from multiple vendors

- Information systems enable **customer-level tracking**
  - Using the data about their customers
  - Understand who's buying what
  - For how long, and what other products that they're buying

## III. Data-Driven Business Models

Examples: Harrahs & TESCO

## IV. Direct Marketing

1. The individual customer is the **unit** of analysis

2. **Know who their customers** are and what they buy

3. Aim to **determine marketing communication** based on past purchases

4. Constantly determined (and leverage) individual **customer value**

   > We can collect all this data about our customers, about each and every one of them, and we can actually build a business by understanding who the valuable customers are, who the less valuable ones are, which messages we should be sending to which customers at which time, and, importantly, what kinds of products we can develop and deliver in order to create more value for our most valuable customers and to try to attract more customers like them. 

## V. Which Firms Are Customer Centric?

> Which of these retailers are highly "customer centric"?
>
> - [ ] Walmart 
> - [ ] Apple 
> - [ ] Starbucks 
> - [ ] Nordstrom 
> - [ ] All of them
> - [x] None of them

> 1. Walmart doesn't have the loyalty program / know regional difference but not in a specific granular way; new program called "Scan & Go" scanning process more efficient;  
>
> 2. Apple: product-centric; tracking ppl music preferences through iTunes; 
> 3. Starbucks: at local: very customer-centric, being a trusted advisor; not customer centric at a national level; 
> 4. Nordstrom: fail to figure out the customer's future value, they just treat everybody really well

## VI. What is Customer Centricity?

**Customer centricity** is a strategy that <u>aligns a company's development/delivery</u> of its products/services around the **current and future** needs of <u>a select set of customers</u> in order to <u>maximize their **long-term** financial value</u> to the firm. 

Customer centricity requires the company to be willing and able to change its organizational design, performance metrics, and employee/distributor incentive structures to focus on this long-run value creation/delivery process. 

> Customer centricity requires us to look ahead, figure out who the valuable customers will be and do things for them to help them recognize that we have their best interests in mind.

## VII. More Reflections on Customer Centricity

Customer centricity does NOT suggest that "non-focal" customers should be ignored or "fired"; to the contrary, it is important to have a healthy proportion of such customers to add a high degree of stability and robustness to the overall customer base. (Think of them like cash in an investment portfolio.)

To focus on customers, the company has to first know who the customer is. Organization should come up with a single, consensus answer to this question, or at least reconcile the roles/relationships of the different potential customers. There may be some barriers to make the company to be customer centric. A lot of money is needed to build information technology systems and we need a number of employees to develop a data infrastructure over customers. But it's worth the efforts and risks especially when your product relies on customers heavily. 

## VIII. Questions on Customer Centricity

- Who is the **customer**? 
  - Have to get some agreement on that question
  - Care a lot about the others but one kind of customer matters more than others
  - ★★ Organization should come up with a single, consensus answer to this question, or at least reconcile the roles/relationships of the different potential customers
- What are the major **barriers** to account for? Develop a comprehensive list, ranked by the importance/difficulty of each barrier
  - Cannot get the data for a few reasons: regulatory issues; cultural reasons; cannot treat customers differently (pharmaceutical space)
- What **resources** can you utilize to overcome these barriers? 
  - Financial: money to build information technology systems and to hire employees and to start developing a data infrastructure
  - Cultural: hire the right people
- Thoughts about what competitors are doing in this area?
  - Areas like Financial services / Hotels and hospitality already have moved towards customer centricity
  - Sometimes to do customer centricity because no one's doing it (Hammers and Tesco)
- Does it make sense for your organization to become customer centric? If so what should be your immediate goals and medium-term expectations?
  - Make plans noe
  - Start laying some of the baby steps towards it
