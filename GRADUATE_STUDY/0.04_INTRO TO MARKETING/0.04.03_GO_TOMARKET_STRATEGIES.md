## I. ONLINE/OFFLINE COMPETITION

#### Why offline is still important?

Even though the internet "liberates" consumers there are still some "disutility costs" associated with buying online as more than 90% of what is sold to consumers is still sold offline.

This is because there are still frictions: (especially groceries)

- delivery times
- Uncertainty about "fit and feel" of certain products 
- Cost of returns (time and money)

#### Completion is intense for popular products, but almost non-existent for niche products 

- For example, when an offline bookstore opens in a neighborhood, *amazon.com* sales in that neighborhood decline; but only for popular books like *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* and not for niche books like *101 Years of All Black Trivia*

## II. FRICTION

#### 1. Search Friction

Who will have the best price and assortment?

1987: Find the price - buy the product at the store or incur the **search and time cost** to get in your car and drive to another store to find a cheaper deal

2013: go to https://milo.com / yelp

#### 2. Geographic Friction

New York City vs. Iowa City

**The location that you live in imposes certain costs and delivers particular benefits.**

The internet can deliver you from the "tyranny" of your local options.

## III. The Long Tail

#### 1. Description

Red area=products that sell the most in the physical store

Orange area=products so unpopular and so niche

Internet makes us have all the access to the tail

#### 2. Background

Historically, we lived in a world of "**hits**" but now live in a world of infinite slots

#### 3. Hypotheses

- The Long Tail exists because the economics of storage and distribution have changed; this is the **supply side**
  - on the supply side, because of the Internet, it's now possible for sellers to just offer a lot more variety, whether it's variety of beer, diapers, flowers, movies, songs, you name it. It's possible to offer a lot more variety because the economics of distributing those products has changed dramatically.

- The Long Tail is itself endogenous (**demand side**) as there are more ways for us to discover variety
  - our tastes now are becoming more varied because, simply, we have access to more variety of product than we ever had before. 

#### 4. Old-New Economics

##### Common 80/20 Rule

​	1897: Vilfredo Pareto found 20% of population owned 80% of the wealth (in the UK) giving rise to the Law of the Vital Few

​	NOW: **80**% of the profits that we make are based on only **20**% of the products that we sell, or **20**% of the customers that we have. 

##### Zipf's Law

​	1949: George Zipf found that **2nd** most common word used **1/2** as much as the the **1st**; **3rd 1/3** as much, etc.

#### 5. Key Principles

- The ***tyranny of locality*** (relate this idea to the concept of *preference minorities*)
  - The things that are available to you locally are dictated by whatever the local sellers decide to offer you and they may be different from your own taste.
- An audience that is **spread too thin geographically** used to not get served
  - e.g., Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India opened on only two screens

#### 6. Main Characteristics

- **The ratio of niche products to "hits"** is changing
  - Now there's more demand coming from all of those niche products. Being added together.
- **Distribution efficiency** is amplifying (digital, search, etc.)
  - You can now get access particularily to content-type products on tablets, and also mobile phones. 
- **Recommendations and reviews** drive search so that consumers get into the tail
- *Collective* value of niches > hits (找到针对兴趣的)
- "A long tail is just culture filtered unfiltered by scarcity"

#### 7. Research Findings

Disentangling the supply side (larger product availability) from the demand side (easier for consumers to find and sample new products)

MIT study obtained data from a retailer offering identical product selection and prices through two different channels: Internet and catalog

Descriptive evidence is that internet sales are significantly less concentrated (even after controlling for differences in customers and supply side factors such as taxes and shipping)

##### Gini coefficient 

![image-20190820162835403](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20190820162835403.png)

- Used to understand the equality or inequality of incomes within a country
  - C=50% B=20% the bottom 50% of people in this particular country have about ONLY 20% of all of the income.
  - all of the wealth was held by a very, very small number of people

- Used to understand the equality or inequality of sales across various products sold by a particular firm
  - almost all of the sales were just coming from one or two products

##### Findings

- **less concentrated**: The results hold up when differences in the customer groups are controlled for too (Internet customers are younger, have more income)

- **More equal, egalitarian(平等主义的) for the internet**: the internet channel has more evenly distributed sales and the difference cannot be attributed to differences in price or availability

  - Unit sales of "niche" products: 14.8% v 12.7%
  - $ sales of "niche" products: 15.0% v 12.7%
  - (Differences are statistically significant)

- The question is now whether there is a demand side explanation, e.g., customer use of search tools on the internet

- Key variables to explain sales of niche products:

  - Directed search
  - Non-directed search
  - Recommendation system

- All computed as percentages in terms of page views e.g., Directed search views/total views

  

  The long tail is a **supply side** story. I can offer more variety. But it's also a **demand side** story. I'm more able find things that exactly ma, match my tastes. And what's clever about this study, is the office controlled **the supply side**, and they found there was more long tail like sales on the internet compared to the catalog and the reason was this **demand side explanation**.

X can also = LOCATIONS

[^Geo(physical) distance / social distance]: the sales of an Internet retailer also spread out in a long tail fashion across geographies. In the beginning, the sales take off in very big markets, like New York, like Chicago, like Los Angeles and San Francisco. But over time, you start to pick up other locations in the tail that might be quite spread out from each other in terms of physical distance, but the customers in those markets share the same kind of characteristics.

#### 8. Critiques and Summary

- **Law of** ***natural monopoly*** (hits get disproportionate share of light users)

  - light users like people who don't watch movies very often let's say, they tend to gravitate towards the head, so we're still going to need those products on the head, they're still going to be, in some markets, kind of a **hit driven** phenomenon or a hit driven culture.

- **Law of *double jeopardy*** (unfamiliar things are less well liked)

  [^Well-liked]: 吃香，适销对路

## IV. Preference Isolation

#### 1. Principle

- "**isolated**" prospects are worth pursuing
- **Preference isolation** brings shoppers online and explains geographic breakdown of online brand demand

##### Research Findings:

- (**Preference Minority Index or PM Index**

  the darker the color, or the darker the shading, customers are more **isolated**.)

- Unit volumes of different brands in zip code *z* in MSA 

  - *m* is an integer count, regressed on demographics and Preference Minority Index
  - *b* value significant and >0 for Preference Minority Index for all brands but largest effect is for niche brands

- Compare 90th **percentile** vs. 10th percentile **PMI**

  - Category sales 50% higher
  - More isolated, the higher online demands
  - Niche brand sales 125% higher
