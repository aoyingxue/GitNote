## Online advertising natural experiment

1. Cross-tab results are shown below:

   Because rows represent the total number of times one person visited Yahoo and columns represent the number of times one person visited Yahoo on an even second, for example when row=3, the person visited Yahoo during the campaign for 3 times in total, he cannot visited Yahoo beyond 3 times on an even second. So in the same row but columns whose index is larger than 2, the results are 0. 

   And also with the number of times one visited Yahoo increases, the number of times one was exposed on an even second increases and its distribution is quite symmetric. 

2. The randomization check failed. Because in the regression with week1 as the outcome, treatment has a positive 0.304 estimated effect on week1 purchases and it's significant statistically. However, after running a regression with week0 as the outcome, we could find the similar effect as week1. So it means that no matter it's before or after the treatment, there's a statistically significantly positive effect on the purchases. 

   ```{r}
   summary(lm(week1~treatment_ad_exposures_week1,df))
   summary(lm(week0~treatment_ad_exposures_week1,df))
   ```

3. Between \# of ad exposures on even seconds and the purchases of week 1, there'a a complier  \# of ad exposures in total. The more the person comes to Yahoo, the more chance for the ad to be seen by him, and the more purchases can be done. However, there's a trend we could see from the first question that the more people coming to Yahoo, the more he sees the ad. So the treatment didn't select random people instead of the people who are more willing to come to the website and see the ads, therefore there's a trend on the effect on purchases in week 0. Now we could fix the effect of "total_ad_exposures_week1" to make sure that we select the same group of people who will come to the website at the same frequency to treatment and calculate the fixed effect of treatment on week 0. We could see now it's not significant statistically. The randomization check pass. 

   ```R
   summary(felm(week0~treatment_ad_exposures_week1|total_ad_exposures_week1,df))
   ```

4. The treatment effect of each ad exposure on purchases during the week of the campaign itself is 0.065043. 

   ```R
   summary(felm(week1~treatment_ad_exposures_week1|total_ad_exposures_week1,df))
   ```

5. The causal effect of each treatment ad exposure on purchases in the weeks after the campaign is -0.08233.

   ```R
   purchase_after <- select(df,-c(treatment_ad_exposures_week1,total_ad_exposures_week1,week0,week1))
   purchase_after <- purchase_after %>% mutate(total=rowSums(purchase_after))
   df <- cbind(df,total=purchase_after$total)
   summary(felm(total~treatment_ad_exposures_week1|total_ad_exposures_week1,df))
   ```

6. One possibility is that a large portion of people who came to the website very often, got exposed by the ad and purchased more may buy things depending on the ads they've seen. They would just click through the ad that they think interesting or useful and then buy it through the link provided. After the campaign, they don't see the ad of the company and then just go buy from other brands which have ads on the website, hence the purchase after the campaign for those who got exposed more would decrease. The advertisements seem to be very effective to those people because they increase their purchases at the campaign week and decrease after they didn't see the ads. 
7. If both who use ad blockers and who visit on odd seconds seeing the ads are randomly assigned, the causal effect of each ad exposure on purchases during the week of the campaign itself would be 0.065043/(1-10%-30%)=0.1084.
