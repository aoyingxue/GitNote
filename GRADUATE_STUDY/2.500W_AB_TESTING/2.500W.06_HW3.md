## Problem 1

1. We could know that the coefficient estimate of "Any bin" is 0.187, which is statistically significant, and the standard error is 0.032. So the estimated ATE of providing bin is 0.187*1=0.187 kg. The 95% confidence interval is equal to ate±1.96\*se=(0.12428, 0.24972). 

2. Same as (a), we could get the coefficient as -0.024 and the standard error is 0.039. But the coefficient is not statistically significant. So the estimated ATE of sending SMS is -0.024 kg. The 95% confidence interval is equal to ate±1.96\*se=(-0.10044, 0.05244). 

3. Outcome measures (1)-(4), including "*Percentage of visits turned in bag", "Avg. no. of bins turned in per week", "Avg. weight (in kg) of recyclables turned in per week", "Avg. market value of recyclables given per week"*, show statistically significant effects of providing a recycling bin. 
4. None of the outcome measures shows statistically significant effects of sending text messages. 
5. The estimated ATE will not change much on providing a recycling bin. But the standard error will increase because adding covariates into regression will improve the model. 
6. I don't think "has cell phone" would be a bad control, because it is not any outcome variables or variables that would be affected by the treatment. It's measured before the treatment was administered. 

## Problem 2

1. After regression,

   ```{r}
   wfh.lm <- lm(perform_during~wfh)
   summary(wfh.lm)
   ```

   We get the result below:

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd6jy28vw0j30sc06mjs7.jpg" alt="image-20200325094022193" style="zoom:50%;" />

   The estimated ATE is 0.3474. The standard error is 0.07019, so the 95% confidence interval is (0.2098276, 0.4849724). 

2. We do almost the same as (a) below:

   ```{r}
   wfh.lm <- lm(perform_during~wfh+perform_before)
   summary(wfh.lm)
   ```

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd6k1svcu8j30tw07cq44.jpg" alt="image-20200325094401283" style="zoom:50%;" />

   The estimated ATE is 0.33447. The 95% confidence interval is (0.211676, 0.457264). 

3. The new regression results are shown below:

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd6kccddsyj30ry0683zc.jpg" alt="image-20200325095408686" style="zoom:50%;" />

   The estimated ATE is 0.32365. The 95% confidence interval is (0.1903504, 0.4569496). 

4. (b) is the most precise, which has the smallest standard error and the narrowest confidence interval. Because "perform_before" is also a covariate that can strongly predict the performance during working from home. 

5. After running regression of perform_before on wfh, the p-value here is far larger than 0.05, which means "wfh" isn't statistically significant on predicting "perform_before". The treatment "wfh" indeed cannot affect "perform_before" and there's not much difference on the "perform_before" across the treatment and control groups. The study's conclusion is valid.

## Problem 3

1. We should cluster standard errors when estimating ATE at household level, because the treatment was assigned at the household level. All voters who live in the same households will get the same treatment so we need to cluster standard errors at the level where the treatment is assigned. 

2. The results of the regression are shown below:

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd6mvlqb5bj30vu09yjth.jpg" alt="image-20200325112150944" style="zoom:50%;" />

   The ATE of "treatment_civicduty" is 0.017899. The ATE of "treatment_hawthorne" is 0.025736. The ATE of "treatment_neighbors" is 0.081310. The ATE of "treatment_self" is 0.048513. 

3. The regression results are shown below:

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd6of4xnhlj30xo09876f.jpg" alt="image-20200325121513009" style="zoom:50%;" />

4. The standard errors for "treatment_civicduty" is now 0.0031108. The standard errors for "treatment_hawthorne" is now 0.0031270. The standard errors for "treatment_neighbors" is now 0.0032236. The standard errors for "treatment_self" is now 0.0031678. 

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd6olsl5i7j30z60i2n20.jpg" alt="image-20200325122136264" style="zoom:50%;" />

5. Because whether they voted or not in the previous elections and other demographic information are useful to predict the outcome. Adding covariates to the regression could increase precision. So the standard error would decrease like the results shown in (d).

6. All four treatments can bring statistically significant positive effects towards increasing voter turnout. Social pressure indeed can increase voter turnout to some extent. Neighbor is the most efficient variable among four treatments. 
7. No, we shouldn't add November as an additional covariate because it happened after the treatment. It's one of the outcomes and the results of the experiment. It can be affected by the experiment. If adding it into the regression on the right hand side, it would be a "bad control" and decrease the precision of the regression. 
8. No, I won't add August 2006 into the regression, either. For the same reason as (g), even though August happened before November (the outcome), August still happened after the treatment, which was affected by the treatment too. We only want to know whether the mailings will affect voter in November, so August is not a covariate but an outcome by the mailings in July in this case. 

## Problem 4

1. It shows an example of **clustering** because in every team they either was treated or not. They were assigned to the same treatment. Managers and team members must be assigned to the same system together but they can be observed individually. Clustered assignment will **decrease** the statistical power especially when there're only 50 teams and the number of clusters is small. 
2. **Blocking** to control the gender variable in this case will increase the power of the experiment, because different gender may result in different effect before and after treatment. For example, we could make sure there are the same proportions (50%) of females or males randomly assigned in each treatment or control group.
