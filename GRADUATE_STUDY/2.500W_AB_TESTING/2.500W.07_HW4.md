### 1. Interpreting Regression Results for HTE

1. P-value of the red box is larger than 0.05, so it's not statistically significant. There's not much evidence the outcome differs by only Treatment 3. The coefficient is 0.248, which means if there's only treatment 3 implemented to the renter, the water consumption for the renter will increase 0.248 thousand of gallons during the summer. Approximately 95% of the predictions should fall within ±1.96*0.754=1.478 from the actual value. 
2. Without any treatment, an <u>owner</u> will use 2.634 thousand of gallons of water **more** than a <u>renter</u>. Approximately 95% of the predictions should fall within ±1.96*0.341=0.898 from the actual value.The predictions are quite precise. P-value is smaller than 0.01, which means it's statistically significant and the amount of water used differs much by whether it's an owner or renter. 
3. Treatment 3 (strong social norm) will bring 2.101 thousand of gallons of water **less** to the group if the group is owners (high=1), compared to the group of renters (high=0). Approximately 95% of the predictions should fall within ±1.96*0.808=1.584 from the actual value. P-value is smaller than 0.01, which means it's statistically significant and there's evidence that the treatment 3 effect differs by the covariate "owner or not". 
4. For owners, the treatment effect of the strong social norm message is 0.248+(-2.101)=-1.853. (If ignoring 0.248 because of its lack in statistical power, it would be -2.101. )
5. For renters, the treatment effect of the strong social norm message is 0.248. (If ignoring 0.248 because of its lack in statistical power, it would be 0. )

### 2. Non-Compliance: Encouraging Participation

1. The placebo design makes sure the comparison is between the compliers between two groups. There is likely to be a great difference between the never-takers and the compliers. Compliers who opened the door are likely to be more active than the never-takers who won't answer the door. It's only comparable between the compliers. 

2. One assumption is the canvassers can correctly identify the same kind of compliers who opened the door in placebo group and the treatment group. For example, if the canvassing of the placebo group and the treatment group doesn't happen at the same day, there may be other variables such as some school events influencing the results. 

3. The average intent-to-treat effect is 0.13208.

   ```{r}
   ## manually calculated
   mean(hw4_data$turnout[treatment==1])-mean(hw4_data$turnout[treatment==0])
   ```

4. After clustering the standard errors on the dorm level and running the regression, the p-value is smaller than 0.05. So the intent-to-treat effect is statistically significant. 

   ```{r}
   summary(lm.cluster(turnout~treatment,data=hw4_data,dormid))
   ```

5. CACE of the canvassing conversations (contact) is 0.14909. 

   ```{r}
   summary(ivreg(turnout~contact|treatment,data = hw4_data))
   # or calculated manually
   alpha <- mean(contact[treatment==1])
   summary(lm(turnout~treatment,data=hw4_data))$coefficients[2,1:2]/alpha
   ```

6. Among the variables in the equation, $\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$ must be greater than 0, and  $l_n$ is likely to be greater than 0, which means $\tau+l_c$ need to be large enough to make sure of the overall positive ITT. So the effect of canvassing, the effect of the leaflet to the compilers will be the main causal effects contributing to the positive ITT.

7. Assume $l_c=l_n=1\%$, CACE=0.137805

   ```r
   l <- 0.01
   ITT <- 0.1320778
   CACE <- (ITT-(1-alpha)*l)/alpha-l
   ```

8. If $l_c=0, l_n=3%$, CACE=0.1452284

   ```{r}
   ln <- 0.03
   lc <- 0
   CACE <- (ITT-(1-alpha)*ln)/alpha-lc
   ```

### 3. Non-Compliance in the C-Suite

1. There are non-takers in those people who were sent emails to but wouldn't open the mail and won't realize they received the coupon. Those who opened the mail are likely to be more active users than those who wouldn't realize. Compliers and never-takers are not comparable. So the plan is flawed. 

   The ideal experiment should be comparing those who were in the treatment group, opened the mail and received the coupon with those who were in the control group, would've opened the mail but didn't receive the coupon. But problem is that it's hard to identify the compliers in the control group. We could consider sending some other placebo incentives to a group of people to test the compliance rate of opening the mail, or make a peek-through window to make sure those getting the mail could see the coupon before opening the mail.

2. Firstly, now the statistical power of the ATE is just well-powered enough. However, the standard error of estimating CACE is much larger than ATE. And also, the estimated effect is only \$2. It's quite small and we need much smaller standard error to make the estimate more accurate. So it means we need more samples to estimate CACE with enough statistical power. 

3. The hypothetical set of potential outcomes of compliers and never-takers are in the following table.  

   $ATE =((200+300+400+100+200+50)-(100+200+300+200+400+200))/6= -25$ $CACE =(200+300+400)-(100+200+300)/3= 100$  

   |               | Next year purchase <br />if opened the mail | Next year purchase <br />if did not open the mail |
   | :-----------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
   |  Complier 1   |                     200                     |                        100                        |
   |  Complier 2   |                     300                     |                        200                        |
   |  Complier 3   |                     400                     |                        300                        |
   | Never-taker 1 |                     100                     |                        200                        |
   | Never-taker 2 |                     200                     |                        400                        |
   | Never-taker 3 |                     50                      |                        200                        |

4. The never-takers won't be observed in the non-compliance case. But they could be more inactive in receiving mails and also more unwilling to make purchases in the next year than the compliers. They may be the ones who really dislike advertising or promotion mails or dislike the brand. Knowing there's a promotion mail of the brand may bring negative effect to them, which makes them lose interest in the company and make much less purchase in the next year. The large negative effect brought by them will make the true ATE negative, if the never-takers are forced to be treated in this case. However, they won't receive the treatment in the real world, they won't affect the complier's effect so the CACE will still be positive.  

5. I don't agree with the CEO's interpretation. Sending coupons and automatically cutting prices are conceptually different. Using coupons is more of a conscious action. It's much harder to use coupons for consumers. The consumer who uses the coupon knows about the promotion and willingly spends more for that. But offering automatic price deduction may have a totally different effect on the outcome. Now cutting prices for all consumers is making all consumers compliers. The outcome offering promotion at registers to everyone cannot be predicted using the current experiment on coupons.
6. I don't agree with their interpretation. As their data indicated, the true compliance rate ($\alpha$) is 5%, which is much lower than 50% as I estimated. $CACE=ITT/\alpha$, which means the smaller the $\alpha$ is, the higher CACE is. In this case, the coupons were likely more effective. 
7. We should redo the experiment. Because we don't know what part of people who got the wrong postage is for now, whether they are randomly assigned to the wrong postage (maybe they are all never-takers or compliers, etc.), whether the rest of the sample can represent the population, etc. So we cannot estimate the effect of sending a letter with correct postage accurately with enough statistical power using the wrong data. 
8. Reassign those who received the mail in the control group to the treatment group and those who didn't receive the mail in the treatment group to the control group and use the same calculation as before.
