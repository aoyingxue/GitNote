#### Summary of Lab #3

**Exercise**

1- Download a file "[Web Sample Tweets 2009.csv](https://wustl.instructure.com/courses/31856/files/762556/download?wrap=1)[![Preview the document](1.07.03_Assignment.assets/preview.png)](https://wustl.instructure.com/courses/31856/files/762556/download?wrap=1)" from Canvas

2- Upload it to your home directory

*Active the drag-drop option in VMBox. Look at the VBoxSettings page on Canvas. Then drag and drop your file into Cloudera*

3- Using bash commands, take only tweets column and save it as "tweets.txt" (Hint: You may use awk or cut). Report the exact commands and parameters.

```bash
cut –d “,” –f 6 Web\ Sample\ Twitts\ 2009.csv > tweets.txt
```

4- Run wordcount MapReduce job on "tweets.txt".

On terminal:

```bash
cd /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/

cp hadoop-examples.jar ~/

cd ~

hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar wordcount tweets.txt output
```

5- Load the results into Hive and report your Hive commands for tasks 6 to 9. You need to create the table for this file.

On terminal:

```
hdfs dfs –get output/part-r-00000

hdfs dfs –chmod 777 output
```

On Hive:

```bash
CREATE TABLE wordcount (word STRING, freq INT) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED On FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' STORED AS TEXTFILE;

LOAD DATA INPATH “/user/cloudera/output/part-r-00000” INTO TABLE wordcount;
```

6- Show the top 10 words in terms of the frequency and report the results.

```
SELECT * FROM wordcount SORT BY freq DESC LIMIT 10;
```

7- Show the 10 lowest frequent words and report the results.

```
SELECT * FROM wordcount SORT BY freq ASC LIMIT 10;
```

8- Show which words had a frequency of 50 to 100 and report the results.

```
SELECT * FROM wordcount WHERE freq>50 AND freq<100 SORT BY freq DESC;
```

9- Perform the last three questions by Impala and create a table contains the time to execute the code in both languages (Hive and Impala).

Generally run time in Impala is less than Hive
