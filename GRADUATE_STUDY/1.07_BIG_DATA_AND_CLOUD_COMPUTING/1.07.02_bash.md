#### **| (<u>piping</u>)** : 

use one output of a command as an input to the other command

#### wordcount: frequency of the words (wc) 

How many lines it does have? How many words are in the Shakespeare text file?

```bash
wc t8.shakespeare.txt
```

##### wc: -l lines; -w words; -c bytes / -m characters

#### Shuffle 

#### How to deal with header?

```bash
#get headers
head -1 Live.csv > Header.csv
tail -n+2 Live.csv | shuf -n 100 > samplewithouthead.csv #print the whole file without the header and then shuffle; save into another file
cat Header.csv samplewithouthead.csv > sample.csv #combine two files and save into another file
```

#### chmod (change mode)

R: read 4

W: write 2

X: executable 1 

Root (admin) / groups / anyone

#### history

Every command that we has tried so far

How to access the history command without typing or copying?

```bash
!13
!! #the previous command
```

#### grep

Find some words in files (正则化)

```bash
#find x in any files in my current folder
grep e *

#count how many words including 9
grep -c "9" times.csv

#find some command in history and return the number of the command
history | grep ssh

#find the number of lines containing "video"
grep "video" Live.csv -c
```

#### cut

-d, --delimiter=DELIM  use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter

-f, --fields=LIST    select only these fields; also print any line

​              that contains no delimiter character, unless

​              the -s option is specified

```bash
#cut using "," and get the second column
cut -d "," -f 2 Live.csv | less
```

#### sort

**-r Option:** **Sorting In Reverse Order**

**-n Option** : To sort a file **numerically** used –n option

#### uniq

##### Best <u>sort</u> before uniq!!! Otherwise there may be different 

-c, --count     prefix lines by the number of occurrences

-d, --repeated    only print duplicate lines, one for each group

-u, --unique     only print unique lines

```bash
uniq -d Live.csv #print the repeated lines
uniq -u live.csv #print the unique lines
```

#### tr

Unix is sensitive about the characters so it needs <u>translation</u>

"<"

```bash
cat Live.csv | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | less #change the lowercase to uppercase
cat Live.csv | tr -d "photo" | less #delete "photo"
```

```bash
tr " " "\n" < t8.shakespeare.txt
```

#### quiz 1

```bash
wget https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt

#How many lines it does have? How many words are in the Shakespeare text file?
wc t8.shakespeare.txt
## wc: -l lines; -w words; -c bytes / -m characters

#How many unique words are in the file? 
tr " " "\n" < t8.shakespeare.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l

#What is the most frequent word? And how many times?
cat t8.shakespeare.txt | tr " " "\n" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
```

```bash
#How many lines does it have?
wc -l flights.csv

#How many unique destinations are there? (12列)
cut -d "," -f 12 flights.csv | uniq -c | wc -l

#What carrier has been used most? How many times? (8列)
cut -d "," -f 8 flights.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
```
