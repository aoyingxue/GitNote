### 3V's of Big Data

#### Volume 

#### Variety

- Relational Data (Tables, transaction, …)
- Text Data (Web)
- Semi-structured Data (XML) 
- Graph Data
  - Social Network
- Streaming Data 
  - You can only scan the data once
- A single application can be generating/collecting many types of data 
- Big Public Data (online, weather, finance, etc.) 

#### Velocity 

- Data is begin generated **fast** and need to be processed fast
- Online Data Analytics
- Late decisions ➞ missing opportunities
- Examples
  - E-Promotions: Based on your current location, your purchase history, what you like ➞ send promotions right now for store next to you
  - Healthcare monitoring: sensors monitoring your activities and body ➞ any abnormal measurements require immediate reaction
- Other V’s:
  - **Value** 
  - **Veracity** : reflecting the fact that data should be trustworthy

### Cases 1

#### **Big Data Analytics**  

- Big data analytics is where advanced analytic techniques operate on big data
- Consider the following analysis problems:
  - When you try to load a big file into Excel, a system error happens
  - When you try to multiple a matrix to a vector, your computer runs out of memory
    - **PageRank** (first used by google)
  - When you try to join two big tables in SQL server

##### Any industries using big data? What are they doing ?

- Movie industry
  - Netflix
- Manufacturing industry
  - General Electric
  - Additive Manufacturing (3D metal printing)
- Supply Chain
  - FedEx
- Healthcare
  - IBM Watson
  - 1Data Project

####   **Netflix**  

- When you <u>pause, rewind, or fast forward</u>
- <u>What day</u> you watch content (Netflix has found people watch TV shows during the week and movies during the weekend.)
- The date you watch
- What <u>time</u> you watch content
- <u>Where</u> you watch (zip code)
- What <u>device</u> you use to watch (Do you like to use your tablet for TV shows and your Roku for movies? Do people access the Just for Kids feature more on their iPads, etc.?)
- When you pause and leave content (and if you ever come back)
- The <u>ratings</u> given (about 4 million per day)
- <u>Searches</u> (about 3 million per day)
- Browsing and scrolling behavior
- Netflix also looks at <u>data within movies</u>. (Characters, country, language, stars)

### Cases 2

####   **Additive Manufacturing**  3D printing

####   **Fedex**

#### 1Data

- Collecting information from 
  - FDA
  - Drugbank
  - Pubchem
  - MedDRA
- Making intelligent drug recommendation using predictive models

### Cases 3

----------------

### Intro to Hadoop

- Data Storage, Manipulation, and Retrieval
  - Hadoop (in Java, R, Python, …)
    - HDFS (storage) and MapReduce (processing) are the two core **components** of Apache **Hadoop**. 
  - Map Reduce (a parallel computing paradigm)
- Analytics
  - Data on rest (batch computing)
  - Data on stream (using algorithm)
- Data Visualization
  - Communicating your analytic results

#### Hadoop 

- A top-level Apache project in the Apache Software Foundation written in <u>Java</u>
- A computing environment built on top of a distributed clustered file system that was designed specifically for very large-scale data operation
- Hadoop was inspired by Google (distributed) File system (GFS) and MapReduce programing paradigm

#### MapReduce 

A programming paradigm in which work is broken into mapper and reducer tasks to manipulate data that is stored across a cluster of servers for massive parallelism

#### **Data On Rest**  

- Data rests in a database, data warehouse, a cluster of computing nodes, a cloud
- **Issues of Dark Data** 
  - **Dark data** is **data** which is acquired through various computer network operations but not used in any manner to derive insights or for decision making.
- Data is <u>available</u> when and if we want it
- Make unstructured data <u>structured</u>
- <u>Chop</u> large problems into <u>small</u> ones
- <u>Mining</u> useful information or <u>association</u>
- Finding significant <u>factors</u>

####   Data On Stream

- Data arrives so rapidly that it is not feasible to store it all in active storage
- Algorithms should be used to
  - Summarize the stream data
  - Make a useful sample of a stream
  - Filter a stream to eliminate the undesirable elements
  - Use fixed-length window on a stream
