# Hypertext Transfer Protocol

## [HTTP (Links to an external site.)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Resources_and_specifications)

The protocol used for accessing most web content.

------

# User Agents

- Software that retrieves web content
  - Web browser
  - Bots and crawlers
  - Alexa

------

# Web Browsers

- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer

----------

# Mobile Devices

- Varying screen sizes
- Different interaction behavior
- Screen Readers
- Used by those with visual impairments.
- Read out the contents of a computer screen to the user
- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): provides guidelines for designing websites that are accessible to screen readers

-------

Websites are often visited by users with a diverse array of browsers, operating systems, and devices. Web Developers must make a site accessible to as many users as possible.

Some user agents can be challenging to support, or may not be able to access modern technology.

# Clients & Servers

![Illustration of client-server communication.](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gj28compnmj30m4078dhc.jpg)

- Client makes a *request*.
- Server provides a *response*.

------

# Client

A client *requests* content.

------

## Clients

Referred to as the "front end" because it's the part that users interact with.

------

# Server

A server *provides* content.

Called "the back end".

------

## Servers

- Can use any operating system.
- Often built to handle large volume.
- Use web server software like:
  - Apache
  - Nginx
  - IIS

------

- Web hosting companies run large specialized computers that act as web servers for many many websites and can handle lots of traffic

## Web Hosting

- A website must be on a public server to be publicly available.
- Web hosting is usually provided by a specialty company or service.
- Big web hosting companies host tens of thousands of sites or more.Those servers must be:
- Cooled
- Maintained
- Secured

------

## Virtualization

- A server can be virtually segmented into smaller units.
  - Resources are shared.
  - Costs are reduced.
- Most web hosts use virtualization.

### Virtual Private Server (VPS)

- Some security risk

------

## Cloud Web Hosting

Create virtual servers with a nearly unlimited pool of resources to draw from. Cloud providers usually provide:

- Scaling
- Management tools
- DNS
- Networking configuration
- Databases
- etc.

Pros: Cheaper (usually pay per usage), easier, usually automatically managed

Cons: Some security risk, less control, vendor lock-in

------

### Cloud Web Hosting Providers

- Amazon Web Services (https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Microsoft Azure (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- Google Cloud (https://cloud.google.com/)
- Digital Ocean (https://www.digitalocean.com/)

------

# URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)

- Shows up at the top of your browser window.
- Specifies the location of web content.
- Pronounced "You-Are-Ell" or "Earl".
- URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
- Also called an *address*.

## URL Components

- Protocol/Scheme

- Subdomain (optional)

- Domain

- Top-Level Domain (TLD)

- Port (optional, defaults to 80)

- Path

- Filename (optional)

- Query arguments (optional)

- Fragment (optional)

  ![image-20200916142157750](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1git3j162qhj31190u07in.jpg)

## Protocol

**http://** www.google.com/

Also called "scheme".

- http:// (insecure)
- https:// (**secure**)

Always use secure when possible!

------

## Subdomain

https:// **support** .apple.com/

The subdomain is *optional*.

Used to refer to individual computers. The "www" was the short name for most web servers.

Examples:

- www
- docs
- support

------

## Domain

https://support. **apple.com** /

- Domain: The main address of the website.
- For example, "google.com"

**Top Level Domain (TLD)**

- .com
- .net
- .org
- etc...

----------

## Port

http://localhost: **4000** /

- Port is a number.
- Used to identify a particular piece of server software.
- Defaults to "80" for insecure, or "443" for secure.

------

## Path and/or Filename

https://www.imdb.com **/title/tt0109739/**

- Defaults to "/".
  - "/" is Called the "**root**" of the domain.
- Optional filename and extension.
- Ex.: "index.html".

------

## Fragment

Directs the browser to a specific part of the page.

You can use a fragment to link to the bottom of the page, or the middle of the page, or the top.

------

# Requesting a Web Page

1. Your browser requests content for a URL.
2. Look up **IP address** for the domain.
3. Contact the server (by IP) to return content for the URL.

## 1. Request the URL

"Hey, I'd like to see the content at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Astley."

------

## 2. Look up the Server's IP Address

- Wikipedia.com is just a pointer!
- Your computer has to use an IP address.
- IP addresses are found by looking up a domain in a DNS server.
- DNS stands for **Domain Name System**.

```
en.wikipedia.org -> 208.80.154.224
```

------

## 3. Talk directly to the Server

- Use the IP address to request content.
- User agent passes in lots of extra info.

------

# Domain Name System (DNS)

![image-20200916142808834](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1git3pf1tb8j318e0m2wl9.jpg)

------

## IP Addresses

Since a domain is just a pointer, you need an IP address to get content.

Two types of IP addresses:

- IPv4 (ex.: 192.168.0.1)
- IPv6 (ex.: fe80:0:0:0:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf)

Your browser handles this behind the scenes.

------

## DNS Servers

DNS servers are run by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and large technology companies like Google and Microsoft.

------

# HTTP Transactions

An HTTP **transaction** consists of:

1. The **request**.
2. The **response**.

------

## HTTP Request Header

Consists of:

- **URL**
- Method (or "verb")
- User agent
- Metadata
- Language
- How did I get here?
- Technology supported by user-agent

------

## HTTP Request Methods

! This tells the server how to **process our request**.

- GET: simple content request.
- POST: create new content.
- PUT: Update existing content.
- DELETE: Delete existing content.
- OPTIONS: List methods supported for a URL.

https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them

------

# HTTP Request Headers

- **Host**
- **Accept**
- **Accept-Language**
- **Cookie**
- **User-Agent**
- **Content-Type** 

------

## "Host" Request Header

- The **domain name** the user is requesting.
  - Often a single server will serve multiple domains.

----

## "Accept" Request Header

What kind of **media** are we asking for?

Examples:

- `*/*` = I'll take anything.
- `text/html` = An html file.
- `image/jpeg` = A JPEG image file.

------

## "Accept-Language" Request Header

What language should the server respond in?

A user agent can request multiple languages, and the server will choose the best fit.

Example: `en-US,en` (American English, or any kind of English).

------

## "Cookie" Request Header

**Data stored in the browser** that is sent back to the server.

```
class=CSE204,semester=Spring 2020
```

------

## "User-Agent" Request Header

Describes the **software** used to make the request.

- `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.79 Safari/537.36 Edge/14.14393`
- `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36`

------

## "Content-Type"

Describes the **format** of the data. Examples:

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `application/json`
- `text/plain`
- `image/jpeg`
- `application/zip`

------

# HTTP Request Body

Data sent by the user via:

- **POST**
- **PUT**

------

## Example Request Body: form

Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

```
field1=value1&field2=value2
```

------

## Example Request Body: json

Content-Type: `application/json`

```
{
   "course" : "CSE204",
   "year" : "2020",
   "semester" : "spring"
}
```

------

# HTTP Response Codes

## Groups

- 1xx: Information
- 2xx: Success!
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client error
- 5xx: Server error

We probably won't encounter 1xx responses in this class.

------

# HTTP Response Codes (More Info)

After the server has received and processed the request, a HTTP Response is sent, which can contain several elements: HTTP Response Code is a numeric value that indicates the status of the response

- 200: Successful response (success)
- 301: The resource has <u>permanently</u> moved (redirection)
- 302: The resource has <u>temporarily</u> moved (redirection)
- 404: The requested resource was not found (client error)
- 500: Internal server error (server error)

Many other status codes exist. 2xx responses indicate a success, 3xx indicate a redirection, 4xx indicate a client error, and 5xx indicate a server error.

------

## HTTP Response Headers

Include **metadata** about the response.

- Age
- Expires
- Content-Language
- Content-Type
- Content-Length
- Server
- Set-Cookie
- Location

------

## `Age` Response Header

Time elapsed in **seconds** since the content was cached.

- How recent the content is (stock data or time-essential data)

------

## `Expires` Response Header

Date when server should fetch new content.

------

## `Content-Language` Response Header

Indicates the language of the content.

------

## `Content-Type` Response Header

Indicates the type of content being returned.

------

## `Content-Length` Response Header

Indicates the length of the content being returned.

------

## `Server` Response Header

Indicates the type and version of the web server software returning the response.

Example: `Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)`

------

## `Set-Cookie` Response Header

Provides a **key value pair** and instructs the browser to save them and include them in all future requests.

------

## `Location` Response Header

A **URL** included with redirect responses (3xx response code) and 201 responses.

Indicates where a redirect should go, or where newly created content is located.

------

## HTTP Response Body

This is the data that was requested.

Most likely, it is:

- HTML
- JSON data
- image file

------

# Security

- Uses *https*
- Has an 's'
- Uses port **443** instead of 80

------

## HTTPS Protocol

HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that encrypts all communication between the client and the server HTTPS requests begin with "https://" and typically use port 443 instead of 80 Without HTTPS, it is possible for outside parties to intercept, read, and modify the data being sent between the client and server. Because HTTPS securely encrypts all communication between the client and server, it is not possible for anyone other than the client or server to read the data being communicated It is becoming more and more common for any website to require a HTTPS connection at all times in order to prevent malicious tampering, even if the website does not contain sensitive data.

------

## Certificate Authorities

https://www.incapsula.com/cdn-guide/cdn-and-ssl-tls.html

A Certificate Authority (CA) is responsible for issuing cryptographic certificates to trusted websites. These certs typically cost some money and require some sort of verification. CAs are typically large, trusted companies and they work with browser vendors and internet providers https://letsencrypt.org/ is a free certificate authority HTTPS requires a "handshake" prior to sending data where the client and server agree on an encryption method, exchange public keys, and verify that they can communicate securely To use HTTPS, software on the server is required (openSSL, and apache or nginx module)

------

## How HTTPS Works

https://docs.pexip.com/admin/certificate_management.htm

------

## Clock Analogy

There's an easy way to understand HTTPS by using paint and clocks. See [this link (Links to an external site.)](https://gizmodo.com/easily-understand-encryption-using-paint-and-clocks-5888567) if you'd like to know more.
