# API Security

- **API keys** are like passwords.
- Don't put them in **public repos**.

------

# Review: Document Object Model

The DOM lets us:

- Access HTML elements
- **Bind Javascript code to events**, like:
  - click
  - form submit

------

# Review: AJAX

AJAX is the pattern we use to call remote servers after page load.

- Uses `XMLHttpRequest` object.
- We have to define `onreadystatechange` function.
  - Process the response.
- Watch out for CORS.

----

# Application Programming Interface (API)

------

## APIs are the Backend

Modern Applications:

- Have a Javascript application
- **Load data from APIs** 

------

# API Endpoint

------

## API Overview

- An API runs on a server.
- Accessed via HTTP calls.
- We can send data.
- We can receive data.
- May require authentication.

------

## Authentication

Authentication is usually **sent in the header.** 

- Username & password
- Token-based
- API Keys

Both (token and API keys) are usually **long strings** of random characters.

------

## Username & Password

Both sent in HTTP header.

------

## Token Based Authentication

- Username & password are sent to server once.
- Server returns a token.
- Token gets passed to server.
- Username and password are rarely used.

------

# API Keys

- You are assigned an API key.
- The API key corresponds to a user.

------

## API Key Security

- API Keys are like passwords.
- Do not put them in a public repository.

------

## Terminology: Endpoint

A URL that an API accepts.

------

## Endpoint Examples

- `https://cse204.work/name/superhero/clark/kent`
- `https://cse204.work/name/harrypotter/jane/doe/f`

# REST API

**An API Architectural Pattern**

Stands for *Representational State Transfer*.

There is no "official" standard.

------

## REST Concepts

- Single URL
- Multiple HTTP Verb

------

## REST URL Re-Use

URL: `https://people.com/person/1`

- `PUT`: Update/change data.
- `GET`: Read data.
- `DELETE`: Delete this record.

------

## Common Response Codes

- `200`: All good.
- `201`: Item created.
- `400`: Bad request/bad data.
- `401`: Unauthorized.
- `500`: Server broken.

Check API documentation for details.

------

## Partial REST Implementation

Since there's no standard, some APIs:

- Don't re-use URLS
- Use improper HTTP verbs (e.g., use POST instead of PUT)
- Always return 200 response code

Sometimes it's easier for users, sometimes it's easier for the API developers.

------

## Testing With Postman

Graphical client; test out your API responses look like; nice interface 

Not required for this class.

# Final Project Notes

Final Projects must access at *least one* API.

What not to do:

- Don't try to authenticate users. (Build login service)
- Don't use a paid service.
- Don't try to build a multi-user system.(separate data for separate users) That's hard.
