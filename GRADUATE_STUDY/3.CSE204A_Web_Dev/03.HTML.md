## Git: Commit & Push When Things Work!

As you work, remember to commit and push your code often. If you make a change, and everything works, commit & push. That way, even if you lose access to your laptop, you can still access your work. You can also go back to that point if your code gets our of control.

**Be aware that extensions will not be granted for damaged, stolen, or lost laptops!**

------

## Testing Locally

Double-click on your HTML file to view it in a browser.

You don't have to go through the commit-push cycle to test your code. You can test locally by double-clicking on an HTML file to open it in your browser. Make sure to reload your page in the browser each time you make a change.

------

## Install W3C Validator Plugins

You can install plugins that will automatically validate your code as you work. Use of such plugins is *required* for this class.

------

### Visual Studio Code

The recommended HTML validator plugin for Visual Studio Code is called `html-validate`.

1. Click the Extensions icon.
   1. That will open the extensions search dialog.

2. Search for "html-validate".

3. Click the install button for the "html-validate" extension.

------

## Case Sensitive File Systems

Not all laptops have case-sensitive file systems!

**It's best to use lowercase files.**

------

### Good Markup

- Tells the browser, crawlers, and other developers <u>what things represent</u>.
- Improves <u>accessibility</u>.
- Easier <u>maintenance</u>: the more *semantic* your tags are, the easier it is to maintain.

------

## Anatomy of a Website

- HTML - HyperText Markup Language
  - Content and structure
- CSS - <u>Cascading</u> Style Sheets
  - Look and feel
- <u>Javascript</u>
  - Behavior/dynamic features

------

## The Process

1. Your browser downloads HTML from the web server.
2. The HTML includes the CSS and Javascript, either in-line or via links.

------

## HTML

### HyperText Markup Language

Used for site *content*.

*Hypertext* refers to *links* between documents.

------

## CSS

### Cascading Style Sheets

Describes the *presentation* (i.e., look and feel) of content.

------

## Javascript

Adds behavior to otherwise static content.

------

## Codepen.io

If you can't focus, go to [Codepen.io (Links to an external site.)](https://codepen.io/) and start writing some HTML.

------

## Static vs. Dynamic Sites

**Static sites**

- Simple files sent as-is from a server.
- No back-end.

**Dynamic Sites**

- Pull data from a "back-end" or API. 

------

### Static Sites

- Consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.
  - HTML, CSS & JS is called the "front-end".
- Easy to host: just upload!

------

### Dynamic Sites

- Use software hosted on the server to generate custom HTML for each request.
- The server part is called the "back end" of a web app.
- Examples:
  - Sites with a login.
  - E-commerce sites.
  - Weather sites.

------

------

## WYSIWYG Site Builders

- <u>What You See Is What You Get</u>
- Kind of like MS Word where you can type, draw, and click to build a website exactly how you want it to look
- Software on your computer: Adobe Dreamweaver
- Software on the web: <u>Wix.com, Squarespace.com</u>
- **Pros**: Easy, anyone can do it, may have some plugins for dynamic features such as e-commerce, blogs, etc.
- **Cons**: Very limited, difficult to update, doesn't generate clean code

------

### Content Management Systems (CMS)

Software that gives you a system to manage content.

Examples:

- [Wordpress (Links to an external site.)](https://wordpress.org/)
- Drupal
- Joomla
- Tumblr
- Blogger.com

------

#### Pros & Cons

##### Pros:

- Easy
- Themes
- Plugins

##### Cons:

- Can be difficult to setup
- Limited features
- Security issues

------

### Static Site Generators

> A regularly updated website or web page, typically one run by an individual or small group...

-- https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/

------

### E-Commerce

A site that lets users browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and purchase items.

------

### Brochure Site

A simple web presence, usually changed infrequently.

------

### Application

A site that allows you to log in, save data, and interact.

Examples: Wikipedia, Canvas, Gmail

------

## History of HTML

### Chronology

- 1990 - HTML invented
- 1999 - HTML4 finalized
- 2014 - HTML5 published as a recommendation
- now - **HTML5 is still evolving!**

------

### Facts

- Invented in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.
- Made for sharing research.
- Based on SGML.
- The spec is maintained by the W3C.

------

## HTML!

### The Details

------

### What Is HTML?

- #### HyperText Markup Language

- HTML is the language used to describe the structure of a webpage

- HTML is composed of Elements that include an opening tag and a closing tag.

- The closing tag can be identified by a "/" at the beginning.

```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<hr>
```

------

### Anatomy of an HTML Tag

![image-20200921180110745](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1giz1ym81y3j30u80a2wjt.jpg)

`<p class="important">A long, long time ago...</p>`

`<p>... in a galaxy far, far away...</p>`

- Start tag: `<p>`

- Attributes (optional)

  ```
  class="important"
  ```

  - Value (optional, depending on the attribute)

- Content (most but not all elements can have content)

- End tag (some elements have no end tag): `</p>`

------

## Webpage Structure

- Ultimately, web pages are documents made up of various elements- headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
- Pages often contain a hierarchy of information.
  - Headings and subheadings
  - Lists
    - Nested lists
    - Like this
  - HTML tags surround the content of a webpage to give it structure
  - Elements are nested within each other

------

## Overall Structure

### The `html` Tag

Wraps your whole document.

### The `head` Tag

Contains metadata.

### The `body` Tag

This contains your actual content.

------

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Metadata goes here! -->
    <!-- This is where you put data about your page. -->
  <head>
  <body>
    <!-- This is where you put your content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

------

## The `head` Element

### `title` Tag

- Gives the tab or page a title.
- Shown at top of window.

------

## The `body` Element

Comes immediately after the `<head>` element.

------

## Required Elements

- `<doctype>`
- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`

The `<body>` element is not required...

- But we're going to use it, as it's a *de facto* standard.

------

## A Simple HTML Document

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Exciting Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Your content goes here!
  </body>
</html>
```

- Notice the `doctype`!

------

## Element Attributes

- Give info about an element.
- Belong on the opening tag.
- Include a name and a value.
  - Value should be wrapped in quotes
- Are used by:
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - The browser

------

## Viewing HTML Source

- View Source allows you to see the HTML of any website in your browser
  - **Chrome**: View->Developer->View Source
  - **Firefox**: Tools->Web Developer->Page Source
- Developer Tools lets you change HTML & CSS of the page, see live updates.
  - **Chrome**: View->Developer->Developer Tools
  - **Firefox**: Tools>Web Developer->Toggle Tools
  - **ALL**: Right-click on the web page, click "Inspect Element" to open developer tools focused on a specific element

### You should try this now!

------

## Whitespace

### Between Elements

More than one space, as well as line breaks, will be treated as one space.

- Add as much whitespace as you want!
- Use tabs and indentation to show nesting/hierarchy.

**User agents ignore white space within an HTML document.**

------

### Inside Tags

- No whitespace between `<` and tag name.
- At least one space:
  - Between tag name and attributes.
  - Between attributes.

------

### Examples

Use this syntax: `<tag attribute="value">`

Or this:

```
<tag
    attribute1="value"
    attribute2="value"
>
```

------

## Semantic vs. Non-Semantic

- Semantic denotes meaning.
- Non-Semantic denotes appearance.

------

## A Note On Safari

- This class uses Google Chrome
- You should use Chrome or Firefox for this class.
- *You may use Safari, but you are expected to know and use it's Dev Tools.*

------

## Doctype

- Specifies HTML version.
- Necessary because HTML changes.
- First thing in your HTML.

------

### HTML4 Doctype:

```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

------

### HTML5 makes this easy:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

------

## Comments

```
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

Comments:

- Don't show up in the browser.
- **Can be seen by anyone (so don't put secret stuff in there)**
- Should be used to:
  - Explain portions of your code
  - Mark new sections
- Can temporarily remove code.
- Most code editors use `cmd` + `/` or `ctrl` + `/` as a shortcut.

------

### Headings

Summarize or organize the content that follows.

------

# Level 1 Heading: `<h1>`

## Level 2 Heading: `<h2>`

### Level 3 Heading: `<h3>`

#### Level 4 Heading: `<h4>`

##### Level 5 Heading: `<h5>`

###### Level 6 Heading: `<h6>`

------

### Paragraphs: `<p>`

- tag wraps individual paragraphs of text.
- Browsers add:
  - a new line
  - some margin.

<p>Hello, world!</p>

------

### ~~Bold: `<b>`~~

- Makes text appear bold by default.
- Indicates that text that should *appear* different.

#### Don't Use This!

------

### ~~Italic: `<i>`~~

- The *tag will make text appear italic by default.*
- Italics can be used to indicate a section of text that should be said different, such as a technical term or foreign word.

#### Don't Use This!

------

### Strong: `<strong>`

Styled as bold, same as `<b>`

Indicates:

- Importance
- Seriousness
- Urgency

------

### Emphasis: `<em>`

Indicates that content has emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.

#### Examples

- I *think* Ivy was the first.
- I think *Ivy* was the first.
- I think Ivy was the *first*.

Styled as italics, same as `<i>`

------

## HTML

Used for structure and semantics.

## CSS

Used for styling.

------

### Superscript: `<sup>`

is used to contain characters that are superscript.

------

### Subscript: `<sub>`

is used to contain characters that should be subscript.

------

### ~~Line Break: `<br>`~~

- `<br>` will manually insert a new line

### **Don't use this!**

If you are using the appropriate tags, you shouldn't need to add extra new lines. You should *not* use multiple BRs to create large empty spaces.

------

### Horizontal Rule: `<hr>`

*Actually means "End of section"*.

- `<hr>` will insert a line break and a horizontal line.

Proper definition:

> The hr element represents a paragraph-level thematic break.

[W3C hr spec (Links to an external site.)](http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/hr.html)

------

## Self-Closing Tags

- `<br>` and `<hr>` are known as empty elements or self-closing tags because they are not meant to contain content.
- They do not require a closing tag.
- There's a deprecated syntax that's valid but not recommended: `<br />`

------

## Semantic Elements

Semantic elements are not intended to be structural, but add meaning to content.

These elements have some default styling, and can be customized further. However, the primary purpose of these elements is NOT style- they should only be used when they are enhancing the meaning of the content. I.e. if you want to make a heading bold, don't use `<strong>`, use a heading tag and style it how you want 

Examples: `<strong>`, `<emphasis>` quotations abbreviations

------

### `<blockquote>`

- Used for longer quotes that take an entire paragraph.
- You still need to use the `<p>` tag inside.

The "cite" attribute may be used to provide a URL with more information about the source of the quotation.

```
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">
<p>Html stands for "HyperText Markup Language"</p>
</blockquote>
```

------

### Short quote: `<q>`

Used for shorter quotes that sit inline within a paragraph

```
<p>
  When Dave asks HAL to open the pod bay door, HAL answers:
  <q cite="https://www.imdb.com/qt0396921">I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.</q>
</p>
```

------

### Abbreviations: `<abbr>`

Used for abbreviations and acronyms. The "title" attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term 

I.e. `<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the best!` 

On **hover**, the browser will show the full term in a tooltip

------

### Citations: `<cite>`

Used to list a <u>reference</u>. Browsers render the cite element in *italics*.

------

### Definitions: `<dfn>`

Used when explaining or defining a term for the first time.

```
<p><dfn>The Internet</dfn> is a network of connected computers and servers</p>
```

Some browsers *italicise*, Chrome and Safari do not

------

### Address: `<address>`

`<address>` can be used to wrap <u>contact info</u> for an article.

------

### Insertions: `<ins>`

Show content that has been inserted into a document.

- Usually styled as <u>underline</u>

------

### Deletions: `<del>`

Content that has been deleted from a document.

- Usually styled as <u>strikethrough</u>

------

### Strikethrough: `<s>`

Content that is no longer accurate or relevant but should not be deleted.

I.e. Was $900 Now $800

------

### Lists

- Consist of:
  - The list
  - A series of items

------

#### Types of Lists

- Ordered
- Unordered
- Definition List

Can be nested inside each other.

------

##### Unordered Lists: `<ul>`

Bullet points.

- First
- Second
- Third

```
<ul>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ul>
```

------

##### Ordered Lists: `<ol>`

Numbered elements.

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

```
<ul>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ul>
```

------

#### Definition Lists

**Not Commonly Used!**

- `<dl>` wraps the entire list
- Each item is a pair:
  - `<dt>`: term being defined (definition term)
  - `<dd>`: definition

------

##### Definition List Example

```
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>Hypertext Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>
```

```
HTML
  Hypertext Markup Language
CSS
  Cascading Style Sheets
```

------

## Hyperlinks

### `<a>`

- The **a** stands for "**anchor**"!
- Content between the opening `<a>` and `</a>` tag is **clickable**.
- `href` attribute indicates where the link should will take you.

------

### Example

<a href="http://www.google.com">Click Here</a>

- Blue and underlined by default.
- Purple once clicked.

------

## Absolute vs. Relative URLs

Absolute: Gives Everything

Relative: Based on Current URL

------

## Absolute URLs

Must contain the full path, including protocol.

<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>

------

## Relative URLs

| Target        | Example           |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Same folder   | about.html        |
| Child folder  | folder/about.html |
| Parent folder | ../about.html     |
| Domain root   | /                 |
| File in root  | /about.html       |

Example: `<a href="/about.html">About Us</a>`

------

## Email Links: `<a href='mailto:xxx@xxx.com'>`

Use `mailto:` to send email.

`<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Email Someone</a>`

------

## New Window/Tab, IDs: `<a href='' target='_blank'>`

The **"target" attribute** opens in a new window/tab.

`<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>`

------

## Anchor / URL Fragment "#"

You can use a # at the end of a href to link to a **specific id element** on a page

```
<a href="#about-us">About Us</a>
<a href="http://www.google.com#about-us">About Us</a>
```

------

## Images

### `<img>`

- `src` attribute specifies the url to the image.
- **`alt` attribute provides a text description of the image (always use this).**
  - Used for screen readers, or if the image is no longer accessible
  - Can be left empty if graphic is just decorative and has no meaning
- Optional attribute: "**title**" provides a tooltip on mouse **hover**
- Different from "alt"
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` semantic elements can add a caption.

### No End Tag

The `<img>` tag has no end tag, since the element itself cannot have child elements.

------

### Examples

Image with alt text:

```
<img src="images/bird.jpg" alt="Bird Picture" title="A Bird" />
```

Figure containing image:

```
<figure>
  <img src="http://wikipedia.org/birdimage.png" alt="Bird">
  <figcaption>This is a bird</figcaption>
</figure>
```

------

### Image Size

- `height` and `width` attributes are *recommended*, but not required.
- Without height and width, the page may "jump" as the browser finds the image dimensions.
- Image sizes can be specified with CSS in addition to attributes.
- **Always resize** your images to fit the page.
- [Pixlr (Links to an external site.)](https://pixlr.com/editor/) is a good free image editor.

------

#### Resize Your Images!

Don't include full-res digital photos on a webpage. 

------

### Choosing the Right Size

These are recommendations, not strict rules!

| Usage         | Size Range  |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Icons         | 50-100px    |
| Thumbnails    | 100-300px   |
| Image Gallery | 300-500px   |
| Full-width    | 1000-1920px |

------

### Image Formats

#### PNG (.png):

- Supports transparency, generally larger file sizes

#### JPEG (.jpeg or .jpg):

- No transparency, best for photographs and images with lots of different colors, can compress for smaller file sizes.

#### GIF (.gif):

- Supports animation, limited transparency (straight lines), best for illustrations or images with few colors.

------

## Tables

- HTML tables allow you to create a grid of cells to display data or information.
- Tables should **NOT** be used for:
  - Creating a page layout (like a sidebar)
  - Site navigation or menus
- Tables should be used for:
  - **Displaying data**

------

### Table Structure

- `<table>` element creates a table

- `<tr>` creates a **table row**

- `<th>` creates a **table** cell within the current row that contains a row or column **heading**
  - Browsers usually style table headings as bold and centered
  
- `<td>` creates a **table cell** within the current **row**
  - A row can have mutliple elements to create columns
  - "Colspan" attribute will cause a cell to span multiple columns
- "Rowspan" attribute will cause a cell to span multiple rows

------

### Heading, Footer

Longer tables work better with a header, body, and footer `<thead>` wraps the header `<tbody>` wraps the body `<tfoot>` wraps the footer

- Not styled differently by default but can be via CSS
- Allows for some interaction such as scrolling or sorting via Javascript

------

### Table Example

```
<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Month</th>
        <th>Budget</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>January</td>
        <td>$400</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>February</td>
        <td>$450</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

------

### Image of Previous Example

| Month    | Budget |
| -------- | ------ |
| January  | $400   |
| February | $450   |

------

## Validating HTML

- After Assignment 2, all HTML must be valid!
  - Warnings are OK
  - You will lose points for errors.

### Validator Options:

------

## What to do During Class

Can't focus? Write some HTML on Codepen.io.

- Experiment with the tags that we've learned.
- Start building your first site (Personal Bio).
- Make a form.

------

## Testing HTML

### Test in a Browser

- Do not use an "editor preview" for testing.
- Double-click your HTML file to test it.
- You can also drag it onto a browser window.
- Test on Github Pages regularly!
  - Don't wait until the last minute.
- Try pressing `CTRL` + `0` to reset zoom.

------

## Forms

------

## <u>Form</u> HTML Structure

- `<form>` element wraps the whole thing.
- `action` attribute determines **where data is sent**.
- Method specifies HTTP verb.

------

## Simple Form HTML

```html
<form>
  Year: 
  <input type="text" name="year"> //year
  <input type="submit" value="Submit"> //button
</form>
```

------

## HTTP Method

### `GET`

- Forms use GET if no method given. (<u>DEFAULT</u>)
- Retrieves data from server.
- Data goes in <u>URL</u>.
- Response can be <u>bookmarked</u>.

### `POST`

- Submits data for <u>processing</u>.
- Data is in <u>request</u> body, not URL.

------

## `<input>` Element

- `type` attribute specifies text, password, etc.
- `name` attribute is the **key** sent to server.
  - `<input name="year">` sends `year=2020`

------

### `<input>` Type

#### `<input type="text" />`

- Creates a one-line text box

#### `<input type="password" />`

- Creates a password box
- <u>Hides</u> the input

------

## `<textarea>`

- Creates a **multi-line text box** 
- Content inside the `<textarea>` element will be **pre-filled**
- Ex. `<textarea>Your Comments Here</textarea>`

[Forms Demo (Links to an external site.)](https://britton-clapp.github.io/forms-demo/02-text-inputs.html)

------

## Radio Buttons: `<input type="radio" />`

- **Multiple** radio buttons can have the **same name**.
- **Only the selected** will be sent to the server.
- **Only one** radio button in a group can be selected.

------

### Attributes

- **`name` attribute <u>groups</u> radio buttons together.**
- `value` attribute is the value sent to the server. (Single value will be sent)
- `checked` attribute will **pre-select** an option.

------

### Example

```
<input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" />
<input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" />
<input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz" />
```

[Forms Demo (Links to an external site.)](https://britton-clapp.github.io/forms-demo/03-radio-buttons.html)

------

## Checkboxes: `<input type="checkbox" />`

- **`name` attribute groups checkboxes together.**
- **Multiple** checkboxes with same name attribute can be selected.
- `value` attribute is the value sent to the server.
  - Only sent if box is checked!
  - Unchecked boxes are not sent.
- `checked` attribute will pre-check on page load.

------

### Example

```
<input type="checkbox" name="music-service" value="itunes" checked="checked" /> iTunes
<input type="checkbox" name="music-service" value="Spotify" /> Spotify
<input type="checkbox" name="music-service" value="Google Play" /> Google Play
```

[Codepen Example (Links to an external site.)](https://codepen.io/elbrittono/pen/pojqeed)

------

### Checkbox Example (Reformatted)

```
<input 
  type="checkbox" 
  name="music-service"
  value="itunes"
  checked="checked">
iTunes

<input 
  type="checkbox" 
  name="music-service" 
  value="Spotify">
Spotify

<input 
  type="checkbox" 
  name="music-service" 
  value="Google Play">
Google Play
```

------

## Drop Down Lists: `<select>`

`<option>` elements inside select provide the options

Attributes:

- `selected="selected"` **pre-selects** an option on page load.
- `multiple="multiple"` allows multiple selections

------

### List Example

```
<select name="devices" multiple="multiple">
    <option value="ipod" selected="selected">iPod</option>
    <option value="radio">Radio</option>
    <option value="mobile">Mobile Device</option>
</select>
```

------

## File Input: `<input type="file" />`

- Allows users to <u>upload</u> a file.
- Behavior varies between browsers.
- Provides a "browse" button.
  - Opens a window to select a file.

------

## Submit Button: `<input type="submit" />`

- Submits the form.
- The `name` attribute is <u>optional</u>. (Key-value pair, name=value)
- `value` attribute provides the text on the button

Example: `<input type="submit" value="Send Message" />`

------

## Image Button: `<input type="image" />`

- Replaces **submit button with a custom image.**
- Uses normal `<img>` attributes

Example: `<input type="image" src="imges/send.jpg" alt="Send Button" />`

------

## Hidden Inputs: `<input type="hidden" />`

- Creates form controls that will not be shown on the page.

Used for: 

- Submitted timestamp 
- Calculated field
- User id

**Can be seen when viewing page source, so do not use for sensitive information.**

------

## Form Labels: `<label>`

- Creates a label for a **form control**

Location is important!

- Should be obvious which input corresponds to the label.
- Usually above or to the left of the input.
  - Except for checkboxes and radio buttons.

------

### Label-Input Associations

There are two ways to associate a `<label>` with a form element.

- <u>`input` inside the `label`.</u>
- <u>Use the `for` attribute.</u>

------

#### `<input>` inside the `<label>` element.

```html
<label>First Name 
    <input type="text" name="first-name />
</label>
```

------

#### Use the `for` attribute and reference `id`.

```html
<label for="first-name">First Name</label>
<input type="text" name="first-name" id="first-name" />
```

------

## Grouping Form Elements: `<fieldset>`

- Used to group form controls together
- Useful for longer forms

<legend> can be used immediately after the opening <fieldset> to give the fieldset a caption.

```html
<fieldset>
    <legend>Contact Me</legend>
    <label> Email: <input type="text" name="email" /></label>
</fieldset>
```

------

## Form Validation

Browsers implement basic form validation.

- Prevents standard form submission.
- Can be easily circumvented or hacked.

------

- `required` attribute
- `<input type="date">`
- `<input type="email">`
- `<input type="url">`
- `<input type="search">`
- `placeholder` attribute

Adds `:valid` or `:invalid` pseudo-class.

------

### `required` attribute

Indicates that an input is required.

- Form can't be submitted if a required input has no value.

------

### `<input type="date">`

- Adds a date picker box.
- Older browsers show a regular text input.

------

### `<input type="email">`

- Validates the email address entered.
- Some mobile clients add a ".com" button.

------

### `<input type="url">`

- Validates a proper URL.

------

### `<input type="search">`

- Many clients add an "x" to clear the input.

------

## `placeholder` attribute

- Adds text until user enters text.
- Should be an <u>example</u> or explanation of what to enter.

------

## Attributes: `id` & `class`

### `id` Attribute

- Can apply to any element.
- Used to target a single element.
- **Unique** identifier within the document.
- Must start with letter or underscore.
- Used by CSS and Javascript.
- Can have multiple ids.
  - Separate multiples by space.

------

### Class Attribute

#### Kind of like a tag

- Can apply to any element.
- Used to target multiple elements.
- Can apply to different elements.

Ex.:

```
<h1 class="important> … <p class="important">
<p class="important uber-important" id="important-message-1"> … </p>
```

Separate multiple values for the class attribute with a space.

------

## Block Elements

Block elements always appear on a new line. Examples:

- `<h1>`
- `<p>`
- `<ul>`
- `<li>`

------

## Inline Elements

Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as the preceding elements. These are inline elements.

Examples:

- `<a>`
- `<b>`
- `<em>`
- `<img>`
- `<input>`

------

## `<div>`

### Like a folder

- Groups elements together.
- Block level element.
- Contents start on a new line
- Not be styled any differently.

It is a good idea to group sections of your page together with a <div>

------

## `<span>`

### Like an <u>inline</u> folder

- Inline equivalent of <div>.
- Group text to differentiate from surroundings.
- Group inline elements.

------

## `<iframe>`

Loads a separate webpage into a small window.

- Commonly used to embed Google Maps.

iframes use the following attributes: 

-  `src` - the url of the page to show in the iframe 
-  `height` - the height of the iframe in pixels 
- `width` - the width of the iframe in pixels 
-  `seamless="seamless"` - **removes scroll bars from the iframe**

```
<iframe src="http://google.com" height="200" width="200"></iframe>
```

------

## `<meta>`

- Go inside the `<head>` element
- Contain <u>information about your webpage</u>
- Not visible to users
- Provide information to search engines and browsers
- Empty element, <u>no closing tag</u>.
- Uses attributes to carry the information

------

## `<meta>` cont.

```
<meta name="description" content="My webpage…" />
```

Used by search engines, sometimes displayed within results. Should be no more than <u>155 characters</u>.

```
<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
```

Tells search engines not to add this page to search results

------

## Escape Characters

Characters used by HTML can’t be used directly within content, such as < and > or " and ‘. Escape Characters allow you to use these characters within your content

- `<` becomes `&lt;` (lower than)
- `>` becomes `&gt;` (greater than)
- & becomes `&amp; `(ampersand)
- " becomes `&quot;` (quote)

Be careful about quotes in HTML when copying and pasting from non-code sources (like this document) ‘like this’

------

## HTML Formatting

Since whitespace doesn’t affect HTML, you can use it to help your HTML documents easier to read.

```
<ul><li><a href="#">Item <b>1</b></a></li><li><a href="#">Item <b>2</b></li></ul>
```

- Hard to read
- Easy to miss closing tags

Add line breaks and indentation between elements to help show their structure- this will help you catch mistakes! Indentation should follow the structure of the document.

Block level elements should usually be on a new line, inline elements can be inline.

------

## HTML Formatting Cont.

Don’t use spaces in-between parts of HTML attributes

- BAD: `<a href = "www.google.com">< /a >`

- GOOD: `<a href="www.google.com"></a>`

  Both " and ' will work, be consistent.

------

## Semantic Elements

- Not styled differently
- Add meaning to content

------
