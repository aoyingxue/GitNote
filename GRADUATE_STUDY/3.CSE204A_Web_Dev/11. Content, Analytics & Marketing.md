# Writing Good Content

- Clear
- Useful
- Friendly

We'll come back to "selling things" on your website.

------

## Be Clear

- Keep it **simple**.
- Be **specific**.
- Read through your own text.
  - Out loud if necessary!

Examples:

- BAD: "Update your settings to receive fewer communications from us."
- GOOD: "To receive fewer emails, go to Settings > Email Notifications."

Be **consistent** - use names and labels consistently.

------

## Be Concise

Most of the time, shorter is better.

- Start with the main idea: what do people need to know right away?
- Make it **scannable**
- Put related ideas together.
- Use clear headings for long paragraphs.
- Use bullet lists when appropriate.
- Use bold text to emphasize key words.

Break big ideas into manageable bites.

- BAD: "If you haven't already done so, you can sign up for our newsletter to receive deals and special offers delivered directly to your inbox"
- GOOD: "Sign up for our newsletter to get special offers."

------

## Actionable Content

- Content should have a **clear action** associated with it.
- What do you want the user to do after viewing the content?

------

------

### Calls To Action

- Actions the user can take after consuming your content
- Should be the **driving force** behind your website's structure and design.

------

#### How To Make A Call To Action

Think about:

- The **goal** of your website
- What **actions** the user can take.

Associate those actions with appropriate content.

------

------

#### Make Your Calls To Action Stand Out

------

# Conversions

## When users complete a call to action.

Analytics tools (Google Analytics) let you track conversion rates for your content.

------

## Types of Actions

- **View additional content** ("learn more", "watch video")
  - Usually the easiest action, requires the least commitment.
  - Use short "hooks" to pique users' interest.
- **Connect personally** ("subscribe to newsletter", "like facebook page", "contact us")
  - Relatively small amount of commitment but opens channel for continued engagement.
  - Use content that makes users believe in your mission statement and connects with them emotionally.

- **Small steps** ("create account", "free trial", "save for later", "apply now")
  - Bigger commitment but still free, often with a goal of further conversion in the future
  - Often effective after longer content that describes or demonstrates your product/company.
  - Often leads to further calls to action ("upgrade free trial", "add items to cart")
- **Big steps** ("buy now", "add to cart", "contact sales")
  - Biggest commitment, typically involves payment or some type of transaction.
  - Most effective after smaller steps (first click "learn more" then click "buy now")
  - Make sure users have all the info they need to decide if they should engage with the action (don't put "buy now" at the top of your page before your product description.)

------

# Actionable Content

- Drive users to engage and convert.
- Lead users to your Calls To Action.
- All content should lead to a Call To Action.

# Web Analytics

The process for <u>identifying, measuring, and tracking</u> web traffic.

------

## Behind the scenes...

- Visitors are identified
  - by location
  - ip address
  - user-agent string
  - cookies

------

## Traffic

Measured by... 

- pageviews 
- page duration 
- page view order 
- "exits"

------

## Tracking Users

Analytics tools track...

- user behavior as they browse the site
- conversions
- even across multiple sites

------

## Most Common Analytics Services

- Google Analytics
- Mixpanel
- Kissmetrics

------

## Setting Up Analytics

To install, include a small bit of javascript on your site which...

- Tracks user behavior
- Sends data back to the service

------

## Data Collected

------

### Audience

Audience data refers to a description of who is visiting your website. It can include:

- Location (estimated by IP)
- Browser/Device (determined by User Agent string)
- New/Returning user breakdown (cookies)
- Demographics such as age and gender (provided by analytics services and third-party data, i.e. logged in to facebook, facebook shares data with google, google now knows)

------

![audience](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gjvf87mxh4j318g0r379o.jpg)

------

### Acquisition

How users find your website.

------

![acquisition](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gjvf8gw9q9j318g0o4gq6.jpg)

Understanding how users find your website is important for optimizing the user experience, analytics tools provide this info via acquisition data. 

Acquisition data is typically gleaned from the **"referer" HTTP header** which browsers populate with the URL a user was visiting when clicking a link to your website.

------

#### Acquisition Channels

Acquisition is broken down into multiple channels: 

- Direct - user typed in your URL directly 
- Search - user came to your website via a search page 
- Referral - user clicked a link on another website 
- Social - user clicked a link on social media 
- Ads / Campaigns - user clicked an ad or other campaign, such as email campaigns are typically tracked via a url parameter or cookie

------

### Behavior

Analytics tools can track the behavior of users across your site.

------

![behavior](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gjvf968t1xj318g0kfth6.jpg)

------

#### Behavior Metrics

- Landing page: what page did users enter your site on?
- Bounce rate: what percentage of users click a link on your site vs. only viewing one page
- Pageviews: what pages are users viewing, and in what order?
- Page duration: how long are users spending on specific pages?
- Session duration: how long are users spending on your entire site?
- Exit page: what page did the user leave your site on?
- Conversions: did the user engage in any actions on your site?
  - These typically need to be configured manually
  - Examples: add to cart, fill out form, make reservation, etc.

------

### User Signals

User behavior tells search engines if a site is ranked appropriately.

------

#### User Signal Metrics

Measure whether users...

- Click on your page in search results
- Immediately click the back button? (mislink)
- Click a different link instead?
- Stay on your page for several minutes and not return to the results page?

Time spent on page is the most important factor, so providing information quickly and usefully is vital to good SEO.

# Cookies & Tracking

------

## Cookies

<u>Technology that tracks users by triggering the user agent to save data</u>

- Small bits of information that websites can save within the browser.
- Sent along with every request on a specific website.

------

## Cookies vs. Tracking Cookies

- Cookies: store user-relevant data.
- Tracking cookies: track user behavior, often across sites.

------

## How Cookies Work

Tracking Cookies... 

- Contain **unique identifiers** for a user. 
- Can be shared or cross-referenced by third-parties.

------

## Tracking Cookies Example

If a website uses Facebook login or a "like" button...

- Facebook can save a tracking cookie
  - including the users' facebook id.
- That lets Facebook see info about the user's habits outside Facebook.

------

# Search Engine Optimization

------

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The process of tailoring your website for search engines.

Search engines:

- Use complex algorithms to rank your page.
- Algorithms are very secretive.
- Modern SEO is mostly about creating ***good content***.

------

## Web Crawlers

Automated systems that read your websites

- Work on a schedule (daily/weekly)
- Store and organize your content
- Some will let you submit your URL.
- Structured, semantic HTML is vital.

------

## Sitemaps

XML files that list all pages in a website for web crawlers.

- Usually these are generated

------

### Sitemap Example

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"> 
  <url>
    <loc>http://www.example.com/foo.html</loc>
    <lastmod>2018-06-04</lastmod>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

------

For dynamic websites with changing content (like blog posts) sitemaps are typically dynamically generated also to stay up-to-date.

------

# Open Graph Tags

These are used to quickly extract summary and image data from your page.

------

![open-graph-preview](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gjvfa192knj30p00isjt8.jpg)

------

## Open Graph Tags

- `og:image`
- `og:title`
- `og:description`

------

## Open Graph Example

```
<meta property="og:title" content="The Rock" />
<meta property="og:type" content="video.movie" />
<meta property="og:url" content="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/" />
<meta property="og:image" content="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg" />
```
