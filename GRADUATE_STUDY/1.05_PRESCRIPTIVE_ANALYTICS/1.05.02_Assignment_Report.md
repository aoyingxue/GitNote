#### A.  Model in math:

1. The **decision variables** would be the amounts of units we purchase each of the advertising medium: 

   |   Advertising Medium   |  Amount  |
   | :--------------------: | :------: |
   | Half page, daily paper |  $x_1$   |
   | Full page, daily paper |  $x_2$   |
   |   Half page, Sunday    |  $x_3$   |
   |   Full page, Sunday    |  $x_4$   |
   |       daytime tv       |  $x_5$   |
   |       evening tv       |  $x_6$   |
   |   highway billboards   |  $x_7$   |
   |      15-sec radio      |  $x_8$   |
   |      30-sec radio      |  $x_9$   |
   |  Half page, magazine   | $x_{10}$ |
   |  Full page, magazine   | $x_{11}$ |

2. The **objective function** would be maximize the total impact rating, equal to  $maximize \ (55x_1+75x_2+65x_3+80x_4+85x_5+100x_6+35x_7+45x_8+55x_9+50x_{10}+60x_{11})$

3. The **constraints** include:

   1. The costs of each advertising medium cannot be below the minimum numbers of Tom's requirements. In mathematical way of showing it, 

      |   Advertising Medium   | Minimum | Constraints |
      | :--------------------: | :-----: | :---------: |
      | Half page, daily paper |   24    |  $x_1≥24$   |
      | Full page, daily paper |    2    |   $x_2≥2$   |
      |   Half page, Sunday    |    0    |   $x_3≥0$   |
      |   Full page, Sunday    |    2    |   $x_4≥2$   |
      |       daytime tv       |   28    |  $x_5≥28$   |
      |       evening tv       |   28    |  $x_6≥28$   |
      |   highway billboards   |    3    |   $x_7≥3$   |
      |      15-sec radio      |   56    |  $x_8≥56$   |
      |      30-sec radio      |   56    |  $x_9≥56$   |
      |  Half page, magazine   |    0    | $x_{10}≥0$  |
      |  Full page, magazine   |    3    | $x_{11}≥3$  |

   2. The costs of each advertising medium cannot exceed the maximum numbers of Tom's requirements. In mathematical way of showing it,

      |      Advertising Medium       | Maximum |    Constraints     |
      | :---------------------------: | :-----: | :----------------: |
      | Daily paper (half+full page)  |   48    |    $x_1+x_2≤48$    |
      | Sunday paper (half+full page) |    8    |    $x_3+x_4≤8$     |
      |          Daytime TV           |   84    |      $x_5≤84$      |
      |          Evening TV           |   56    |      $x_6≤56$      |
      |      Highway billboards       |   10    |      $x_7≤10$      |
      |         15-sec radio          |   140   |     $x_8≤140$      |
      |         30-sec radio          |   140   |     $x_9≤140$      |
      |   Magazine (half+full page)   |   12    | $x_{10}+x_{11}≤12$ |

   3. The total cost should not be over the total budget of *\$300,000*, which means $800x_1+1400x_2+1200x_3+1800x_4+2500x_5+3500x_6+750x_7+150x_8+300x_9+500x_{10}+900x_{11}≤300,000.$ 

#### B.  Answers to case questions:

##### a.  The optimal solution is:

When we allocate our advertising as the following table and get the maximum total impact rating as **23510**: 

|   Advertising Medium   | Decision |
| :--------------------: | :------: |
| Half page, daily paper |    40    |
| Full page, daily paper |    8     |
|   Half page, Sunday    |    6     |
|   Full page, Sunday    |    2     |
|       daytime tv       |    28    |
|       evening tv       |    28    |
|   highway billboards   |    10    |
|      15-sec radio      |   140    |
|      30-sec radio      |   140    |
|  Half page, magazine   |    9     |
|  Full page, magazine   |    3     |

##### b.  Which of the constraints are "binding"?

Just as the answer report by solver stated, the "binding" status of the constraints are stated as the following table:

|             Name              |       Status       | Slack |
| :---------------------------: | :----------------: | :---: |
|    Half page, daily paper     | Binding by minimum |   0   |
|    Full page, daily paper     |    Not binding     |   6   |
|       Half page, Sunday       | Binding by minimum |   0   |
|       Full page, Sunday       | Binding by minimum |   0   |
|          daytime tv           | Binding by minimum |   0   |
|          evening tv           | Binding by minimum |   0   |
|      highway billboards       |    Not binding     |   7   |
|         15-sec radio          |    Not binding     |  84   |
|         30-sec radio          |    Not binding     |  84   |
|      Half page, magazine      | Binding by minimum |   0   |
|      Full page, magazine      | Binding by minimum |   0   |
| Daily paper (half+full page)  | Binding by maximum |   0   |
| Sunday paper (half+full page) | Binding by maximum |   0   |
|   Magazine (half+full page)   | Binding by maximum |   0   |
|          Total cost           |    Not binding     |  300  |

##### c. If Tom was willing to increase the allowed number of evening TV ads:

From the answer report we obtained and concluded in the table above, we could easily find that "evening TV" is bound by the minimum, not the maximum. Even if we increase the maximum, it cannot constrain the variable and the decision of evening TV will stay the same as 28, the minimum limit. So there will be no change in the optimal solution if Tom increases the allowed number of evening TV ads. 

##### d. If Tom was willing to double the allowed number of radio ads: 

When we allocate our advertising as the following table and get the maximum total impact rating as **30585**, which increases rating by **7075**. 

|   Advertising Medium   | Decision |
| :--------------------: | :------: |
| Half page, daily paper |    24    |
| Full page, daily paper |    2     |
|   Half page, Sunday    |    0     |
|   Full page, Sunday    |    2     |
|       daytime tv       |    28    |
|       evening tv       |    28    |
|   highway billboards   |    3     |
|      15-sec radio      |   280    |
|      30-sec radio      |   198    |
|  Half page, magazine   |    0     |
|  Full page, magazine   |    3     |
