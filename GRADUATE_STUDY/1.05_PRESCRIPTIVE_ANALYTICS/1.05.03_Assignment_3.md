**Questions** 

1. *What is the optimal supply strategy for the month of March? What is the optimal cost?*

   1. *Formulate (in math) a linear program model for this problem. That is, specify the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints of the model.*

      1. ***Decision variables:*** 

      |  Supplier  | Extrafine |   Fine   |  Medium  |  Coarse  |
      | :--------: | :-------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
      |  Ambrosi   | $x_{1A}$  | $x_{2A}$ | $x_{3A}$ | $x_{4A}$ |
      | Bresciani  | $x_{1B}$  | $x_{2B}$ | $x_{3B}$ | $x_{4B}$ |
      |   Castri   | $x_{1C}$  | $x_{2C}$ | $x_{3C}$ | $x_{4C}$ |
      |  De Blasi  | $x_{1D}$  | $x_{2D}$ | $x_{3D}$ | $x_{4D}$ |
      |  Estensi   | $x_{1E}$  | $x_{2E}$ | $x_{3E}$ | $x_{4E}$ |
      | Filatoi R. | $x_{1F}$  | $x_{2F}$ | $x_{3F}$ | $x_{4F}$ |
      |  Giuliani  | $x_{1G}$  | $x_{2G}$ | $x_{3G}$ | $x_{4G}$ |

      2. ***Objective function:*** 

         To minimize the total cost=cost of production and transportation

         $minimize((17.4x_{1B} + 17.4x_{1C} + 17.5x_{1E} + 18.25x_{1F} + 19.75x_{1G} +\\ 13.00x_{2A} + 14.10x_{2B} + 14.22x_{2C} + 14.30x_{2D} + 13.80x_{2E} + 13.90x_{2F} + 13.90x_{2G} +\\ 10.65x_{3A}+11.2x_{3B}+11x_{3C}+11.25x_{3D}+11.4x_{3E}+11.4x_{3F}+10.75x_{3G}+\\ 9.6x_{4A}+ 9.45x_{4B}+9.5x_{4C}+9.6x_{4D}+9.6x_{4E}+8.9x_{4F}+9.4x_{4G})+\\ (0.4x_{1B}+0.8x_{1C}+ 0.7x_{1E} + 0.5x_{1G} +\\ 0.3x_{2A} + 0.4x_{2B} + 0.8x_{2C} + 0.7x_{2D} + 0.7x_{2E} + 0.5x_{2G} +\\ 0.45x_{3A}+0.6x_{3B}+1.2x_{3C}+1.05x_{3D}+1.05x_{3E}+0.75x_{3G}+\\ 0.45x_{4A}+ 0.6x_{4B}+1.2x_{4C}+1.05x_{4D}+1.05x_{4E}+0.75x_{4G}))\\ =minimize(17.8x_{1B}+18.2x_{1C}+18.2x_{1E}++ 18.25x_{1F}+ 20.25x_{1G} +\\ 13.30x_{2A} + 14.50x_{2B} + 15.02x_{2C} + 15x_{2D} + 14.5x_{2E} + 13.90x_{2F} + 14.4x_{2G} +\\ 11.1x_{3A}+11.8x_{3B}+12.2x_{3C}+12.3x_{3D}+12.45x_{3E}+11.4x_{3F}+11.5x_{3G}+\\ 10.05x_{4A}+ 10.05x_{4B}+10.7x_{4C}+10.65x_{4D}+10.65x_{4E}+8.9x_{4F}+10.15x_{4G})$ 

      3. ***Constraints:*** 

         1. Ambrosi and De Blasi cannot produce Extrafine, so $x_{1A}=x_{1D}=0$ . 

         2. Machine hours cannot exceed the production capacity, which means: $0.4x_{2A}+0.375x_{3A}+0.25x_{4A}≤2500\\ 0.7x_{1B}+0.5x_{2B}+0.35x_{3B}+0.25x_{4B}≤3000\\ 0.675x_{1C}+0.45x_{2C}+0.4x_{3C}+0.25x_{4C}≤2500\\ 0.45x_{2D}+0.35x_{3D}+0.2x_{4D}≤2600\\ 0.65x_{1E}+0.45x_{2E}+0.4x_{3E}+0.25x_{4E}≤2500\\ 0.625x_{1F}+0.5x_{2F}+0.425x_{3F}+0.425x_{4F}≤38000\\ 0.7x_{1G}+0.45x_{2G}+0.35x_{3G}+0.4x_{4G}≤2500$ 

         3. Production of each size has to meet the demand, which means:

            $x_{1A}+x_{1B}+x_{1C}+x_{1D}+x_{1E}+x_{1F}+x_{1G}≥25000\\ x_{2A}+x_{2B}+x_{2C}+x_{2D}+x_{2E}+x_{2F}+x_{2G}≥26000\\ x_{3A}+x_{3B}+x_{3C}+x_{3D}+x_{3E}+x_{3F}+x_{3G}≥28000\\ x_{4A}+x_{4B}+x_{4C}+x_{4D}+x_{4E}+x_{4F}+x_{4G}≥28000$ 

         4. All decision variables have to be nonnegative. $x_{ij}≥0$. 

   2. *Construct a spreadsheet model of your formulation and solve it using **Excel’s Solver**. Please make sure that* 

      1. *Simplex LP is the solution method for the problem* 
      2. *No integer constraints should be added to the formulation (Solver will not provide a sensitivity report if an integer constraint is added).* 

      3. *Present the optimal supply strategy in a table format.* 

      The optimal minimum cost is **1382544**.

      |  Supplier  | Extrafine |  Fine  | Medium | Coarse |
      | :--------: | :-------: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
      |  Ambrosi   |     -     | 6,250  |   -    |   -    |
      | Bresciani  |   4,286   |   -    |   -    |   -    |
      |   Castri   |   3,704   |   -    |   -    |   -    |
      |  De Blasi  |     -     |   -    | 2,040  |   -    |
      |  Estensi   |   3,846   |   -    |   -    |   -    |
      | Filatoi R. |  13,164   | 19,750 | 18,817 | 28,000 |
      |  Giuliani  |     -     |   -    | 7,143  |   -    |



2. *Filatoi could slightly expand the production capacity of its existing spinning machines by renting an upgrade. This would increase their spinning production capacity by 600 hours/month. The monthly rental cost is $1,500 / month. Would you recommend that they rent the upgrade? Why or why not?* 

   In the sensitivity report, the allowance increase for Filatoi total hours is 867.0533171 (>600) and the shadow price is -2.117647059, so it can be applied by 100% rule. The cost would decrease \$1271 (<$1500). The additional monthly rental cost cannot be eliminated by the decrease of the cost. So I **wouldn't** recommend.



3. *Your outsourcing production strategy optimization model is based in part on the prices charged by the local mills to Filatoi and on an estimate of Filatoi’s internal production costs. The plant manager, the accounting department, and you estimate that Filatoi’s internal production costs could vary within a 5% range of the figures originally estimated. Consider the following two cases:* 
   1. *All of Filatoi’s internal unit product costs increase by 5%* 
   2. *All of Filatoi’s internal unit production costs decrease by 5%* 

   *Would your recommendation in Question 1 change? Why or why not?* 

   1. Production costs increase by 5% meaning the new production costs for 4 sizes are 19.16, 13.9, 11.4, 8.9. So the objective coefficients for Filatoi increase by 0.91, 0.7, 0.57, 0.45. Only the coefficients for Filatoi Extrafine and Coarse are below the allowable increase, so apparently the 100% rule cannot be applied. However, after re-formulating the program by changing the unit cost of production of Filatoi to 19.16, 13.9, 11.4, 8.9, the optimal solution remain the **same** as Question 1. The total cost would be **1431469**.
   2. Production costs decrease by 5% meaning the objective coefficients for Filatoi decrease by 0.91, 0.7, 0.57, 0.45. All the coefficients for Filatoi except Coarse exceed the allowable decrease, so apparently 100% rule cannot be applied here either. However, after re-formulating the program by changing the unit cost of production of Filatoi to 17.34, 13.21, 10.83, 8.46, the optimal solution remain the **same** as Question 1. And the total cost would be **1333620**.
   3. So my recommendation in Question 1 for those two cases won't change. 

4. *You estimate that the production capacity of De Blasi could vary within a 20% range of the figure shown in Table 2.*  

   1. *+20% increase,* 
   2. *‐20% decrease.* 

   *Would your recommendation change in the two extreme cases: Why or why not?*  

   Production capacity increase/decrease by 20% meaning the production capacity will increase/decrease by 520. Since the allowable increase for De Blast Total Production Hours is extremely large, both optimal solutions will remain the **same** as Question 1. And because shadow price is 0, the total cost would remain the same too, as **1382544**. 

   
   
5. *A client has just called asking for an additional 5,000 kg of the medium size yarn. The original demand still has to be met but Filatoi is considering whether it should accept the new order and what is the minimum price ($/kg) it should charge for it. You can assume that Filatoi can adjust its outsourcing orders with the suppliers.* 

   The allowable increase for total medium size yarn is 5388.445977, which is larger than 5000. So the new order can be accepted even if we don't change the original optimal solution in Question 1. According to the shadow price of 12.3, if Filatoi accept the additional order, the client has to pay at least **\$12.3** per kg to eliminate the additional cost.
