This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
Name = c("Sally", "Mike", "Carol") ## Creating a vector to store names

Gender = c("F", "M", "F") ## Creating a vector to store gender

TenK = c(55, 46, 62) ## Creating a vector to store TenK results

PR = c(52, 44, 58) ## Creating a vector to store PR results

Qualified = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE) ## Creating a vector to store qualification

running = data.frame(Name, Gender, TenK, PR, Qualified) ## Creating a dataframe called running to combine the above vectors together

running ## access the dataframe running

running$HalfMarathon = c(120, 100, 140) ## adding a new column to the running dataframe

running ## access the dataframe running

newrunner = data.frame(Name = "Sage", Gender = "M", TenK = 40, PR = 42, Qualified = TRUE, HalfMarathon = 81) ## Creating a new dataframe

running = rbind(running, newrunner) ## adding a new row to the running dataframe

running
```


```{r}
new_list = list(runif(10, -2, 2), matrix(1:10, 2, 5, byrow = TRUE), running) ## list: first member is a vector of length 10 from uniform distribution from -2 to 2; second member is a mtrix with 2 rows and 5 columns filled byrow; third member is the running dataframe.

new_list ## access the list

new_list[[1]] = new_list[[1]] + 2 ## add 2 to each element of the first member of the list

sum(new_list[[2]]) ## add all elements of the second member of the list

new_list[[3]] <- NULL ## remove third member of the list
```


```{r}
mons = factor(c("March", "April", "January", "November", "January", "September","October", "September", "November", "August", "January", "November", "November","February", "May", "August", "July", "December", "August", "August", "September",
"November", "February", "April"), levels = c("January", "February", "March","April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November","December"), ordered = TRUE)

table(mons)

factor_weight = cut(women$weight, 2, labels = c("Low", "High"))

factor_weight
