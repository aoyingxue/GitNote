- Given K mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, B1, B2, …, Bk, such that 

  P(B1)+ P(B2)+⋯+P(Bk) = 1 , and an observed event A, then

> $$
> P(Bi / A) 
> = [P(A / Bi) ∗ P(Bi)] / [P(A / B1) ∗ P(B1)+P(A / B2) ∗ P(B2)+…+P(A / BK) ∗ P(BK)]
> $$

- Examples:

  > A construction company employs three sales engineers. Engineers 1, 2, and 3 estimate the costs of 30%, 20%, and 50%, respectively, of all jobs bid by the company. For *i* = 1, 2, 3 define *E**i* to be the event that a job is estimated by engineer *i*. The following probabilities describe the rates at which the engineers make serious errors in estimating costs:
  > $$
  > P(error/E1) = 0.01, P(error/E2) = 0.03, and P(error/E3) = 0.02
  > $$

  Question now is:

  > *P*(E1) = 0.3, *P*(*E2*) = 0.2, and *P*(*E3*) = 0.5 
  >
  > *P*(error/*E1*) = 0.01, *P*(error/*E**2*) = 0.03, and *P*(error/*E3*) = 0.02
  >
  > *P*(*E1*/error) = ?

  P(E_1/error)=(P(E_1 )P(error/E_1))/(P(E_1 )P(error/E_1)+ P(E_2 )P(error/E_2)+P(E_3 )P(error/E_3))

    = (0.3 * 0.01)/((0.3*0.01) + (0.2*0.03) + (0.5*0.02))

    = 0.158
