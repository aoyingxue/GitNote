This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
nv1 = vector("numeric",length = 6) # an empty numeric vector of length 6

nv2 = seq(from = 2, to = 20, by = 2) # even numbers from 2 to 20

length(nv2) # length is 10

nv2[6] # sixth element is 12

nv2 = c(nv2, 22) # adding a new element
 
nv2 = nv2[-1] # removing the first element

print(nv2) # printing nv2

mean(nv2) # calculating mean

min(nv2) # calculating minimum

max(nv2) # calculating maximum

sd(nv2) # calculating standard deviation

nv3 = 1:10 # vector 1 to 10

nv3 = nv3 + 3 # add 3 to each element

nv3 = as.character(nv3) # coerce to character

print(nv3) # printing nv3
```
