This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

v3 = seq(1, 29, 2) ## generate odd numbers from 1 to 30

m1 = matrix(v3, nrow = 3, ncol = 5, byrow = FALSE) ## 3 rows, 5 columns, fill by column

m2 = matrix(v3, nrow = 5, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE) ## 5 rows, 3 columns, fill by column 

m1 = m1 + 1 ## add 1 to every element 

m2 = m2 * 2 ## multiplying every element by 2 

t(m2) ## transpose of m2

m1 + t(m2) ## adding transpose of m2 to m1

m1 %*% m2 ## matrix multiplication of m1 and m2


```
