## R Class Module 5 Practice Problem 1 Solution

```{r}
## Constructing a function to convert Celcius to Fahrenheit
c_to_f<-function(C){
F = C*1.8 +32
return(F)
}


c_to_f(26) ## converting 26 degree Celcius to Fahrenheit

```


## R Class Module 5 Practice Problem 2 Solution

```{r}
## Imported nyc_flights.csv to the R environment
flights = read.csv("C:/C/OnlineRClass/nyc_flights.csv")

nrow(flights) ## Number of flights in the data

table(flights$month) ## Number of flights in each month

max(flights$dep_delay,na.rm=TRUE) ## Maximum departure delay

max(flights$air_time,na.rm =TRUE) ## Maximum air time

flights_sample = flights[1:1000,] ## Firts 1000 rows of data

save(flights_sample,file="flights_sample.RData") ## Save the object in RData file

rm(flights_sample) ## Remove the object from the environment

flights_sample ## Access the unavailable object

load("flights_sample.RData") ## Load the saved Rdata file

flights_sample ## Access the reloaded object 

```


## R Class Module 5 Practice Problem 3 Solution

```{r}
library(dplyr) ## load dplyr 

flight_1=select(flights,month,day,origin,dest,air_time)## Creating a new dataframe with month, day, origin, dest, air_time

flight_1=arrange(flight_1,air_time) ## ascending order of air time

print(flight_1[1:10,]) ## Printing first 10 rows

filter(flight_1,month==1,day==1,origin=="LGA") %>%
summarise(mean(air_time,na.rm=TRUE)) ## 4.	Calculating the average air_time for all the flights whose origin is LGA on January 1st

```

## R Class Module 5 Practice Problem 4 Solution

```{r}
names(flights)
delay_route_summary = flights %>%
                       group_by(origin,dest) %>%
                       summarise(
                       avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm =                          TRUE),
                       avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm =                          TRUE),
                       flights = n()
                       ) %>% 
                      arrange(desc(avg_dep_delay))
                      
delay_route_summary

delay_carrier_summary = flights %>%
                       group_by(carrier) %>%
                       summarise(
                       avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay,na.rm =                          TRUE),
                       avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay,na.rm =                          TRUE),
                       tot_distance = sum(distance, na.rm =                           TRUE),
                       ) %>% 
                      arrange(desc(avg_arr_delay))
                      
delay_carrier_summary

```


## R Class Module 5 Practice Problem 5 Solution

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

library(lubridate)

flights$weekday=weekdays(ymd_hms(flights$time_hour))

ggplot(flights) + geom_bar(aes(x=weekday,fill=origin)) + labs(title="Weekday Flights From Each NYC Airport") ##	A bar plot on count of flights for each weekday;	A colored bar plot on count of flights for each weekday from each origin; Titile is “Weekday Flights From Each NYC Airport”


ggplot(flights) + geom_point(aes(x = origin,y=distance)) ## 4.	A scatter plot on distance for each airport; X axis is origin; Y axis is distance
