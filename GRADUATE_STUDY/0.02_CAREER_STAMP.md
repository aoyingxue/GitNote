> I started a subtitle group in 2015 to translate music-related videos and fulfill the gap between electronic music fans in China and around the world. I worked with more than 20 core members in the areas of translation, graphic design for posters and videos, subtitle production, etc. In the meantime, I got the chance to network with people in the music festival industry. My team collaborated with domestic music festival organizations, such as ULTRA CHINA, SUGARLAND, jungle events and so on, to help them publicize music festivals through related music video production and translations. We were also responsible for video editing, subtitle production and publicizing on internet. Until now we attracted more than 10,000 fans in total on the releasing platforms, including 5,000 fans on the main releasing web *bilibili*.
