## Relevant facts and issues

|                            Facts                             |                            Issues                            |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Leaders lack of awareness of cyber security and the importance of updating the systems. | CFO of the company thought the company was safe and not hacked till now. The information is safe enough. He didn't realize the potential damage and the long-term costs would be much more than the short-term budget on updating cybersecurity. |
| Other firms being hacked with some ransomware, so CFO only compromise to agree with updating the systems with the budget he could spare. | Updating systems is only a part of the cyber security. The most vulnerable part is people. The employees don't have a sense of cybersecurity. |
| Randcom 2.0 was released. All systems were looking good and validation checks were in place. | Even though all hardwares were in place, employees were not "trust interface" |
| Randcom was compromised and possible intruder was siphoning funds to an external account. | Not a system glitch but an intrusion using malware installed by employees to get confidential information. |
| Hundreds of customers were starting to complain about the fake website and application | Ran a WHOIS but the IP registered anonymously overseas and was masked. |
| Emailed the team to schedule an urgent meeting but intercom buzzed |      Federal investigators came to find the perpetrator      |

## Identification of the root cause

"People" are the weakest part of the 3 fronts for Randcom. Randcom has developed a budget-centric or profit-centric company culture and executives barely speak of cybersecurity as part of the culture. Employees gave little attention to cybersecurity and there was no clean desk policy. They were constantly ignorant to malware and security of their personal data. Executives pay much more attention to how to lower the short-term cost but ignore the long-term cost if cybersecurity is not in place. 

## Scenarios 

|                    Alternative scenarios                     |                          Advantages                          |                        Disadvantages                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   1. Cybersecurity and risk training provided to employees   | Increase cybersecurity knowledge; <br />decrease internal risks |                More cost;<br />Time consuming                |
| 2. Outsource an expert on cybersecurity and security breach,<br /> and shut down the system for a few days to find the source of the attack. | Expertise on how to find the source of the attack, rebuild the system and block the attacks in the future | Expensive on hiring an expert;<br />time consuming to investigate |

## Recommendation

| :------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| 1. Cybersecurity and risk training provided to employees | Establish policies that force employees to learn cybersecurity;<br />train employees including executives and managers;<br />find those who are careless about showing and sharing confidential information such as passwords and give some proper punishment | Make materials of cybersecurity education;<br />outsource experts to educate and train;<br />evaluation costs |

## Additional questions

#### What are the people, processes, or technology failure points in Randcomâ€™s security that require attention?

- People: Randcom's managers didn't care about the cybersecurity level of their employees, for example, employees often shared passwords and left them written in the open. Nobody really implemented the security policy and cybersecurity isn't in the company culture. Their ignorance of cybersecurity needs attention.
- Processes: Randcom had a cybersecurity process policy on paper but no one was implementing it. Employees could probably not know about it. A lack of legacy system monitoring and encryption require attention. 
- Technology: Randcom was busy updating their systems to 2.0 but they ignored old systems and left their legacy systems unprotected. Internal attacks are ignored. 

#### What is the ethical dilemma for Randcom between choosing greater public access and protecting consumer privacy? Is the CEO unethical? Why or why not?

More development means more access and freedom to the public but in the meantime, it's easier to be penetrated through internet and more costly to increase security requirements such as asset protection and encryption. From the CEO's perspective, it's his responsibility to take care of privacy protection within the budget allocation. I think he's not unethical because he did listen to Ayn about cybersecurity issues and compromised within the budget. He just didn't think of how big the problem could be if cybersecurity was compromised.
