### Root Cause Analysis

- Analysis tool
- Applicable to multiple environments
- Uses systematic approach
- Root cause=the fundamental reason an event occurs
- Root Cause analysis should: 
  - Use a structured approach
  - Look beyond obvious causes
  - Involve stakeholders
  - Be verified
  - Go beyond “human error”

- Facts: car wouldn’t start
- Issues: late for class, had to catch the bus and then walk
- Root causes: did not properly accomplish required routine maintenance
- Alternatives: 1-do nothing, 2-take my car in every 6,000 miles, 3-buy a new car
- Recommendation: 2
- Implications: $$$ for maintenance, HR: will require more of my time

### Root Cause Analysis Example: CS-Fusion

- CS-Fusion experienced a breach after employee clicked on link in phishing email, allowing malware to be downloaded to the computer which exploited a known vulnerability
- Sensitive corporate information was stolen
- A patch existed for the vulnerability, but was not installed
- Anti-phishing and malware defenses did not work
- CS-Fusion does not conduct security awareness training
- There is limited data available for analysis of the event
- Security has a small staff and limited budget
