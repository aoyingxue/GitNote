## Individual Assignment 2

1. AR survey of Business School

   1. Construct an AR perceptual map. Which business school is perceived to be Olin’s closest competitor? How many brand clusters exist in the perceptual map?

      **From the AR map, we could find that Tuck is the closest one to Olin, which means that it's the closest competitor. As for clusters, I think Booth and Kellogg, Goizueta and Owen are two main clusters of brands. Olin and Tuck can be one cluster together. Other brands are scattering quite separate. Therefore, 6 clusters are made in the map.** 

   2. Which attribute(s) seem to be primarily responsible for how well differentiated Olin is perceived to be relative to other business schools?

      **Class size is primarily responsible for differentiation. **

   3. What marketing strategies can Dean Taylor undertake based on this map?

      **Olin could either improve its faculty, placement and prestige or decrease its tuition, but it could never decrease tuition while also improving those three attributes. So maybe the next step to undertake is to try harder on improving faculty, placement and prestige. **

2. Using the dataset titled “4‐CoffeeDataset.xlsx,” run a Scan\*Pro model for Maxwell House in <u>Store B</u> (using <u>only</u> the two brands’ prices as explanatory variables, ignoring displays and features). Then run a Scan\*Pro model for Folgers in Store B (using only the two brands’ prices as explanatory variables, ignoring displays and features).

   1. Between Maxwell House and Folgers, which brand has higher brand equity? Explain its brand equity in words.

      | Maxwell                |            |
      | ---------------------- | ---------- |
      | Brand Equity           | 9.28558962 |
      | Own Price Elasticity   | -1.4711419 |
      | Cross Price Elasticity | 0.39951599 |

      | Folgers                |            |
      | ---------------------- | ---------- |
      | Brand Equity           | 9.91952722 |
      | Own Price Elasticity   | -1.34743   |
      | Cross Price Elasticity | 0.58207091 |

      **From the regression results, we could see that Folgers has higher brand equity, which means that the brand will sell exp(9.92)=20323.38 units in a given time at the Store B if it sets a price of \$1. ** 

   2. Between Maxwell House and Folgers, which brand has higher vulnerability to its competitor’s price cut? Explain its vulnerability in words.

      **Also Folgers has higher vulnerability because of its higher cross price elasticity, which means that the competitor Maxwell decrease its price by 1%, the brand sales will decrease by 0.582%. ** 

   3. Between Maxwell House and Folgers, which brand will gain a larger percentage increase in sales from a 1 % price cut? Why?

      **Maxwell will gain a 1.471% increase and Folgers 1.347%. Therefore, Maxwell will gain 1.471%-1.347%=0.124% increase in sales more than Folgers, because of its larger own price elasticity. **
