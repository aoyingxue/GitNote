## Customer Relationship

- Sustainable Competitive Advantage from a marketing perspective

  - Biggest asset - customers
  - Competitive advantage - close customer relationship
  - Difficult for competitors to steal

  > What is the value of a Prime member? If he/she spent \$100 a year, would it be the value?
  >
  > - Future spending, long-term effect
  > - Acquisition cost missing
  > - Promotional effect (word-by-mouth)

## Customer Relationship Management

Managing a firm’s relationship with current and potential customers to maximize long term profit.

## Traditional View of Profitability

- Focus – Profit in each period
- Profit = revenue – cost
- Sum over all brands in the portfolio
- What can be the problems for marketers?
  - Mass market 
    - Treat everyone the same, but **customers can be different**
  - Short term profit
    - Product and sales oriented

## CRM View of Profitability

- CLV = Customer Lifetime Value (customer equity)
- Summation taken over all *customers (**i**)*
- CLV is based on the profitability of a customer not only in current but in all future periods, as long as the customer is still alive (has not dropped off)
- Calculation of CLV will be in later slides

## Strategic Implications of CRM

- Focus on customers, not products/services
- Classify customers into segments and develop profiles
  - By focusing on current profit, firms might focus on new customer acquisition, ignoring building long term relationship with current customers 
  - CRM helps better understand the true value of existing customers
- More informed judgments 
  - Should you treat current loyal customers differently from new customers? 
  - Should you grow by acquiring new customers or by getting current customers to buy more (e.g. loyalty program)? 
- Targeting strategy
  - Better <u>targeting</u> strategy through understanding how to pick “good” customers and <u>access</u> them
- With <u>competition</u>, positioning and targeting is **even more important**
  - Satisfied customers less likely to switch – targeting can increase switching costs
  - “Own” your customers, take them out from price competition
  - Competitors know less about your important customers – increases acquisition cost of competitors
- Effect on competition
  - When promotional effort is mass directed, direct price competition
  - When Firm A invests in <u>targeting own customers</u>, Firm B can target its customers. <u>Reduce mass promotions</u>

## Calculating CLV

For each customer, <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gj722q91b2j30sq02u0tc.jpg" alt="image-20200928160941792" style="zoom:25%;" /> 

- $Q_t$ = Revenue at time t for all products or services purchased by the customer (e.g. retail, music, video, devices)

- $\pi_t$ = Average gross margin per dollar
- $\theta_t$ = Probability of **customer retention** (still alive)

- β = **Discount** factors (e.g. 1/(1+10%))
  - $\beta^t$ Year t
- $D_t$, $R_t$ = **Development and Retention costs** of current customer *(invest to develop a customer making him buy more)* 
- A = One-time acquisition cost (only for new customers)
- Q, $\pi$, $\theta$, may depend on marketing resources such as price, D and R

Summation taken over many periods

------

- Acquisition cost
  - Mailing lists, brochures, videos, sales calls, telemarketing, search advertising 
  - Loyalty program
- Retention and development cost
  - Mailing cost to current customers
  - Targeted promotion to current customers
  - Clicking cost from current customers at Google
  - Loyalty program

------

## Example (1)

<u>CLV of a new customer</u> (Numerical calculation see “CLV Template.xls”)

- Average spending per purchase = $250
- Average number of purchases per year = 4
- Direct marketing (mailing) cost per year = $9.6 (i.e. development and retention cost)
- Average gross margin = 40%
- Average retention rate = 65%
- One-time acquisition cost = $480  ($9.6 / customer conversion rate = 2%)
- Annual discount rate = 10%

Consider <u>6 years</u> in CLV calculation

- Expected annual revenue per year (cond’l on retention) = $250*4 = $1,000

- Expected gross margin per year (cond’l on retention) = $1,000*40% = $400

- Expected profit per year (cond’l on retention) = $400 - $9.6 = $390

- Retention probability in year t = 65%^(t-1)

- Expected profit in year t (uncond’l on retention) = 65%^(t-1) * \$390

- Expected present value in year 0 (time of acquisition) = [1/(1+10%)^t] * [65%^(t-1) * \$390]

- CLV =<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gj7349rbvqj30ta02a3z3.jpg" alt="image-20200928164546985" style="zoom:25%;" />

  Sum up to six years

- If only consider first year, negative CLV. The longer the time horizon, the higher the CLV

----

##  Customer Acquisition vs. Retention Based on CLV

- Purchase volume, gross margin and retention rate may depend on your marketing investment (D and R)
  - These assumptions are not fixed. 
- Such budget, on the other hand, can be invested in **new customer acquisition** 
- **CLV of existing and new customers different** 
  - Tradeoff between customer development and customer acquisition
