## Main Objectives of Customer Analysis

- To learn customer preferences and needs and purchasing patterns etc.
- To learn how customers evaluate our products vs. our competitors’
- To quantify customers’ reaction to marketing mix that helps to decide optimal strategy
  - Marketing mix should be able to change customers’ purchases in an optimal way
- Note: Customer analysis should <u>identify difference across segments</u>
- Following slides will introduce
  - Data sources
  - Methods used

## Data Sources for Customer Analysis

- Data typically used for customer analysis include
  - Aggregate sales data (grocery data)
    - A.C. Nielson and IRI store panel
  - Customer-level sales data
    - A.C. Nielson and IRI **household** panel and household diary
    - Online/offline customer transaction record
  - Primary research – survey, A/B testing
- The first two types are *real* purchase data, obtained either inside firm or from outside data providers

## 1. Customer Analysis from Aggregate Sales Data

Historical data; only aggregate sales

- Typical sales data of company:
  - Sales in different geographical markets (*k*) in different months/years/seasons (*t*) 
  - Marketing mix data (e.g. price, sales force)
- A simple sales regression:![image-20201012162702527](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gjn994sx68j30kg028mxf.jpg)
- We assume:
  - Base sales (when marketing activities = 0) different across markets
  - Promotion coefficient (*b**1*) the same across markets

- Result interpretations:
  - Intercept = 2.11
  - Coefficient for “sales force” = 2.54
  - Coefficient for “high season” = 1.97
- Only coefficient for sales force is significant (p-value < 0.05)
- What do we learn from simple sales regression?
  - Without sales force, expected sales = 2.11
  - Let the intercept coefficients be different across markets => customer preferences across markets 
    - Measured by *b**k* in different mkt *k
  - How effective are marketing activities in lifting sales?
    - *Change in* *salest* */ change in marketing* *variablet* *=* *b**1* (promotion *coefficient*)
    - Sales increase by 2.54 units as sales force increases by 1 unit
  - Profit analysis:
    - 2.54 sales revenue lift * gross margin – cost of hiring 1 unit sales force
- What **can’t we tell** from this simple sales regression?
  - Who are these customers?
  - What types of customers prefer what types of products?
  - What types of customers are more responsive to sales effort investment? 
  - How does the increased sales effort change the retention rate, future purchases etc.? And how does that change the customer CLV?

## 2. Customer Analysis from Customer-Level Sales Data

- With customer level “panel” data, you can answer these questions
  - First classify your customers into profiles
    - Light vs. heavy users
    - 1st-time, early repeat, core customers (RFM)
  - Next analyze individual customer purchase pattern to understand preferences and responsiveness to marketing mix

### How to answer strategic questions below (think of Amazon):

- **Who are our main customers?**
  - Compare demographics of Prime vs. non-Prime members 
  - Compare demographics of light vs. heavy users
- **What products do our main customers prefer?**
  - Compare purchases of Prime members – categories, brands, seasonality etc.
- **How responsive are our main customers to price promotions?**
  - Amazon ran different types of promotions for different categories in the past 
    - E.g. 10% discount in week 10; 20% discount in week 20 
  - Compare responsiveness of Prime vs. non-Prime members to different promotions

### Typical steps in customer analysis

- Step 1: Customer segmentation
  - Heavy vs. light users
  - Promotion sensitive vs. non-sensitive customers
  - <u>RFM</u>: **core** vs. early repeat vs. first-time buyers (core: **low** recency, high frequency)
- Next step: use higher level analyses to address managerial questions
- Typical questions (<u>CRM</u>):
  - *Who are our core customers?*
    - *Compare demographics of core vs. other customers: income, gender, age, jobs* 
      - Use zip code and <u>census</u> data as a proxy
  - *What are the needs/wants/ preferences of core customers?*
    - Purchases of core customers - categories, brands, seasonality, etc.
  - *What types of promotions can increase purchases from core customers?*
    - Different types of promotions for different products in the past 
      - e.g. 10% discount in week, 20% discount in week 20; marketing data could show when and what type of promotions
    - Responsiveness of core customers to different promotions
  - *Which core customers are about to leave us? What can we do to retain them?*
    - RFM of individual customers. <u>A prediction model of attrition.</u> 
    - Target those with high likelihood of attrition with promotions they like (answer to Q3 in previous slide)
  - *What promotions are most useful to attract new customers?*
    - Look at current customers from the dataset, separate out their first purchases
    - Compare the customer acquisition rate in different months:
      - Months without promotions
      - Price discount
      - Coupon, etc.
    - Use these results to identify which promotions are most useful in attracting new customers

## 3. Customer Analysis from Primary Research 

- Aggregate or customer-level data
  - **Historical data**
  - Results rely on what have been done
  - Projection to new products or new marketing mix often has large uncertainty
    - E.g. a big price promotion way out of sample
- Primary research
  - A/B testing
  - Consumer survey 

### A/B Testing

- A/B testing in digital marketing
  - E-commerce companies are doing this everyday
  - Amazon, e-Bay, Alibaba, NetEase and so on… 
- *Randomly* split consumers into several conditions
  - E.g. testing consumer response to price promotions
    - *Control*: No promotion
    - Treatment group 1: 10% discounts
    - Treatment group 2: 20% discounts
    - Treatment group 3: 30% discounts
- Measure promotion elasticity (treatment effect)
  - 0% to 10%: elasticity =  (average purchase of group 1 – average purchase of control)/10%
  - 10% to 20%: elasticity =  (average purchase of group 2 – average purchase of group 1)/10%
  - And so on…
- Why is A/B testing so popular in digital marketing?
  - Very easy to run experiments online
    - Need a platform to doing that
  - Quickly implement new ideas to selected segments
    - Like test markets
  - Establish *causality*, e.g. a specific promotion leads to increased sales
    - Use secondary data only tells you *correlation* 
    - Causal effects are suspect

### Survey

- Traditionally companies rely on collecting data through survey
- Use survey data to run analysis – *conjoint analysis*
  - E.g. TV set
     Brand + Price + Screen size
- Assume that customers decide buying TV sets based on “attributes” 
  - *U(Brand, Price, Screen size)*
  - U = utility function which captures consumers preferences

### How to Measure *U*?

- In survey, vary the product attributes (brand, price, screen size) to build many (usually 12 or more) hypothetical product concepts
- Then ask respondents to rate/rank/choose among those product concepts
- Based on the respondents’ evaluations/choices of the product concepts, figure out how much unique value (utility) each of the attributes added

### Implications from Conjoint Analysis

- “Brand” is most important attribute, “Price” second, “Screen size” least important 
  - LG dominates the other two brands
  - If you are Sony’s manager, you should invest to improve your brand image
- In MARKSTRAT game, you can do Conjoint Analysis to find out the “utility” for each product attribute
  - Use the results to decide optimal new product

## Learning Points

- Customer analysis key for any strategic planning
- Understand who are your profitable customers and their CLV – CRM approach
- Next step is to understand how your products / services may better match with their needs and wants
- Understand how they will respond to your marketing mix so that you may acquire them or maintain a better relationship with them
- This requires further customer analysis
