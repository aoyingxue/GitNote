## Entry Strategy: Pioneering

- *Pioneering advantage* refers to a persistent market share and/or cost advantage due to the order of entry 
- Advantages come from three sources:
  - Technological Leadership
  - Preemption of Scarce Resources
  - Customer Loyalty / Switching Costs

## 1. Technological Leadership

- Learning Curves
  - Average costs declining over time
  - E.g. P&G’s expertise in diapers market
- R&D and Patents
  - Research experience helps reduce future R&D costs
    - E.g. Pharmaceuticals
  - Patent protection laws
- Market know-how
  - Compared with entrants, incumbents better understand where is the market demand and what consumer wants

## 2. Preemption of Scarce Assets

- Inputs
  - Long-term contracts with suppliers at lower prices
  - E.g. cellular service – pioneers have broader coverage at lower costs and access to property to build towers

## 3. Customer Loyalty / Switching Costs

- Customer uncertainty and learning
  - B-to-C or B-to-B
  - Lower perceived risk among customers
- Brand loyalty
  - Brand preference / brand loyalty 
  - Stable in long term

## First Mover Disadvantages

However, as a pioneer there exist disadvantages:

- Higher investment required
  - R&D
  - Technology diffusion in industry
- Risk
  - Market uncertainty – you may stuck at wrong market position
  - Shift in technology or consumer needs
- Cannibalization
  - New products may cannibalize sales in existing markets
  - E.g. Kodak’s response to digital camera
- Complacency, institutional inertia
  - Believe in pioneer advantages, lack of innovation
  - Too late to respond to challenge from new entrants with better products

## Pioneering: Empirical Evidences 

- Previous studies offer evidence of pioneer advantages
- However, Golder and Tellis (1993) found that these effects are overstated
  - *Selection*: productive firms enter first
  - Findings after control for selection:
    - Average market share of pioneers is about 10%, not 30% as previously found
    - Almost ½ of all pioneers failed
    - Early entrants who enter after pioneers seem to enjoy dominant position for a long time

## Strategic Waiting

- Firms should trade off first mover advantages vs. entering later to avoid risk
  - Exiting and incurring loss vs. entering late after market is tested
- Cases where firms waited to enter and had significant advantages
  - PC market: IBM in 80s, Compaq and Dell in 90s
  - Netscape, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome…
- It you are late, how to compete with first movers?
  - Cost advantages, technology innovation, marketing resources
    - E.g. PC market - Compaq in 90s
    - E.g. Apple’s iPod
  - Differentiate from pioneers
    - Focusing on unserved segments
    - Distributing through new channels e.g. Dell in 90s
  - Break customer inertia
    - E.g. free trials
  - Break incumbent’s dominance of cheaper supplies
    - E.g. supplies from overseas, alternative technologies 

## Incumbent’s Reaction

- How should incumbents react to potential entry?
  - Increase barriers to entry
    - Price
    - Promotions / Advertising
    - Sales force
  - Move first to occupy new positions and/or repositioning
  - Continuous innovations
    - E.g. Intel – 286, 386, 486 Pentium …
    - Avoid complacency

> 1. Correct: Usually as an late entrant, you don't have cost advantage. But there's a condition phase, so it's correct
> 2. Correct: to reduce competition
> 3. Correct: break the consumer inertia 
> 4. Correct: Targeting same segment could be one of the potential strategies
