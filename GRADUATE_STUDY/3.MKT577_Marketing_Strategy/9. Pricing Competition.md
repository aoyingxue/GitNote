## Company objectives and promotions

- Price promotions can help to achieve company’s long term objectives. Some examples below:

## 1. Retail Promotions: How do they Work? 

Majority of promotional effect comes from

1. Brand Switching: switchers vs. loyals

2. Consumption Expansion: increased consumption in the product category (good thing for brand managers)
   1. Income effect
   2. Store switching
   3. Category switching

3. Stockpiling: Purchase Acceleration (not a good thing for brand managers)
   1. Intertemporal substitution
   2. Switchers vs. loyals – Who are more likely to stockpile?
      1. Loyals 
      2. Because they know they will buy them anyway, in this case they would definitely take advantage of the brand 
      3. Sacrificing future sales that has higher margin than lower margin now

### Retail Promotions: A SCAN*PRO Model

- Used by AC Nielson to show clients the **estimated effects** of **retail promotions**
- Including temporary price cuts, feature advertising and special displays
- Including competition effects which may be different across brands
- Use of store-week data
  - Weekly store sales
  - Sales promotion activities

- Own-Brand Promotional Effect of Maxwell price promotion = 1.27
- Brand Switching Effect of Maxwell promotion on Folger’s sales = 0.52
- Stockpiling Effect of Maxwell price promotion = 0.23+0.17+0.09+0.04 = 0.53
- Consumption Expansion Effect of Maxwell price promotion = 1.27–0.52-0.53 = 0.22
- What are the promotional effects for Folgers price promotion?

> - Log(price) last week: now I cut price by 1%, 1 week later, my sales will still suffer from 0.23 ()

For Maxwell

- Total promotion elasticity is -1.27
- Price promotion increases revenue: 1% price cut leads to 1.27% sales volume increase
- Profit may decrease (depends on the margin)
- But it’s not the right metric for promotions
- Brand switching and consumption expansion => promotional elasticity is -0.74

Exercise: *Performance metrics for retail promotions*

- Maxwell runs a retail promotion of 10 percent discount
- If the margin under original price is 30 percent
- 3 performance metrics:
  - (1) What is the lift in sales quantity? 
  - (2) What is the revenue change? 
  - (3) How does the profit change? 
- Should Maxwell runs the retail promotion?

## 2. Trade Promotions

- Off-invoice
  - Retailers get a discount of wholesale price during the promotion period – units bought
- Scan-Back (Dreze and Bell, 2001)
  - Retailer gets discount only on units sold to end-consumers during the promotion period
  - Feasible with scanner data

## Some General Facts

- Trade promotion spending around 13% of net sales among manufacturers, second to cost of goods sold as profit and loss item (1996)
- An important competition tool, esp. when retailers’ market power is high
  - Bitter pill – only 16% are profitable

## Effects from Trade Promotion

1. Increase shipments
2. Forward-buying – increase retailers’ inventory (or **cross-selling** within chains)
3. Retail promotions – price promotion, feature, display
4. Increase retail sales *(only this would benefit manufacturers)*

- Trade promotions are profitable only if retailers help increase retail sales.
- To measure and predict the effectiveness of trade deals/promotions, we need a model to account for above responses.

## A Model of Trade Deals

Involve **3 different regressions**: 

1. **Shipments**

   1. Trade promotions: usually are **wholesale prices** 
   2. Also **elasticity**: How shipment will respond to trade promotions: what's the percentage change of shipment depending on the percentage change of trade promotions 

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gkdw3r0syzj311c044wfe.jpg" alt="image-20201104162223208" style="zoom:40%;" />

2. **Retail Promotions** 

   1. Retail promotions: typically just **retail prices**
   2. $\beta_1$: Pass-through rate; How much benefits offered by the manufacturers will pass to **end consumers** 

   <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gkdw41zt82j311005ct9o.jpg" alt="image-20201104162240287" style="zoom:40%;" />

3. **Retail Sales**

4. **Inventory** (calculation)

## An example of COFFEE

- 10% trade promotion leads to 40% increase in shipments

![image-20201104163334597](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gkdwfehgymj30a604iq3h.jpg)

- However, 10% trade promotion only leads to 5% retail price cut from retailers

![image-20201104163350178](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gkdwfoox3yj30b0058jry.jpg)

- And the 5% retail price cut will lead to **10%** increase in sales volume (log(retail price)\*5%)
- And therefore 30% of the shipment increase goes to retailers’ **inventory holding** *(like consumers, retailers would stock pile)* 

For Maxwell

- To measure the effectiveness of trade promotion should not only look at shipment elasticity due to wholesale price cut (or other forms of trade promotions)
- Retailers may only use trade promotions to increase inventory holding *(stockpiling, in the future, retailers would decrease buying)*
- Real effect of trade promotion may be much smaller

Cost-benefit analysis of trade promotions *(ROI of trade promotion, it's like an investment)*

- Maxwell runs a trade promotion of 10 percent discount of wholesale price
- Suppose the margin at regular wholesale price is $2 per unit. At the regular price the shipment is 1,000 units.
- (1) What is the cost of the promotion? (2) What is the benefit of the promotion?
- Should Maxwell runs the trade promotion?

## Summary

- Retail promotions
  - Own-brand promotional effect = brand switching + stockpiling + consumption expansion
  - Effectiveness of retail promotions is measure by brand switching + consumption expansion
- Trade promotions
  - Effects of trade promotions 
  - Retail promotions + retailers’ inventory
  - Future impacts on shipments and retail sales
  - Effectiveness of trade promotions is measured by the increase of retail sales due to the promotions

### Example 1 - retail promotion

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gkjiu7s7mrj30ky06stb3.jpg" alt="image-20201109131637742" style="zoom:40%;" />

1. Brand-switching effect: 20%\*1=20%
2. Stockpiling effect: 20%\*0.4=8%
3. Consumption expansion effect: 20%\*(2-1-0.4)=12%
4. Maxwell has fewer loyal customer who will only purchase its product than Folgers. When both brands run retail promotions, does Maxwell have a larger or smaller stockpiling effect than Folgers does? 
   1. When a brand has more loyal customers, stockpiling effect would be larger since the loyal are more likely to take advantage of the promotions.

### Example 2 - trade promotion

> 120%-16%-32%=88%

## Price Subsidization 

- *Razor and Blades*: A price model of which one product is sold at low price (or even free) to increase sales for complementary goods
  - E.g. HP subsidized the price of computers and printers to increase sales of office supplies (e.g. paper) with high margin
- Subsidize business partners so that they can sell at low prices
  - E.g. Apple’s iPhone vs app developers
- Metrics to measure the effectiveness in previous slides <u>no longer apply</u> 

#### How should we measure the effectiveness of price subsidization?

- When does price subsidization work?
  - More than one products, targeting same customer
  - Price subsidizing one product brings *positive spillovers* to other products (e.g. printer => paper)
- Which product should be subsidized?
  - Reduced price for the product; brings largest value from increased demand
    - Direct cost: sales of the product/service at subsidy cost
    - **Spillovers**: (*increase demand \* margin*) for other products/services (<u>benefits</u>)
      - Increased demand comes from (1) more customers or (2) more purchases
    - Spillovers must be larger than direct cost

### (An in-class price subsidization exercise: pdf)

Are there any possible benefits that have been ignored in this calculation?

- CLV: if you give discount, then there will be the retention rate changed. We only calculate 1 month profit. 
- If you gain more market sellers, attract more customers, more spillovers (spillover to other business such as prime members)

## Dynamic Price Competition: Product Life Cycles

![image-20201111160811352](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gklz17jfzvj30rk0esgou.jpg)

- Introduction Stage
  - Hope to reach Growth Stage quickly
  - Technical change in product design: high
    - Establishing technology standard as perceived by customers is important
  - Targeted segments 
    - Innovators and early adopters
  - Few competitors in market
    - But more may be coming
- So, what’s the optimal **pricing strategy**?
  - Assuming the objective is to maximize profit over the whole product life cycle
  - <u>Dynamic pricing</u> – price adjusted over time

## Pricing New Products - *Skimming*

- High price and high margin in the early stages
- Lower price later when more customers are attracted to buy

![image-20201111161343825](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gklz6wc2qgj30r609qmxf.jpg)

- A Case Study
  - iPhone launched in June 07, US $599 for 8GB version, US $499 for 4 GB version
  - Huge margin – estimated costs were only US$281 (8 GB) and US$246 (4 GB)
  - 10 weeks later, slashed price by US$200
- Why?
  - Capture higher margin from innovators and early adopters
  - A price discrimination over time
- **Required** conditions for skimming strategy:
  - **Innovators and early adopters** are less price sensitive and have higher willingness to pay
  - There are **few competitors** in the market, or
  - Existing competitors do not have the brand premium

## Pricing New Products - *Penetration*

Example: Netflix (low subscription, now become higher); Freemium

- **Low price first**, sometimes even at a loss
- **Raise price** later when **demand rises**
- Examples:

![image-20201111164757299](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gkm06id2abj30qi0bwq3g.jpg)

- **Why penetration** instead of skimming strategy?
  - Maintain the customer loyalty (main reason)
  - Price out the potential competitors, gain the monopoly and then increase the price
- First think of potential issues with skimming strategy
  - Apple’s pricing strategy for iPhone angered early adopters who have paid premium price (you need to have the loyal customer base like apple)
  - Perceived as “unfair”, lose customer loyalty
  - Further, in a market with aggressive competitors, you may not have the opportunity for skimming
  - When network externality is important, success of a new product relies on
    - Capturing a strong customer base as sustainable competitive advantage – e.g. Facebook
    - Set technology standard – e.g. VCR/DVD
  - Focusing on short-term profit margin may lose future share to existing competitors or late entrants

Penetration is optimal strategy when

- Early adopters are not willing to pay more. Indeed the whole market is highly price sensitive (because of availability of alternative options)
- Existing competitors are aggressive in gaining market share
- Setting industry standard and establishing customer base are important
  - High switching cost once customers get used to it
- Finally, gaining volume is critical for driving down cost
  - In industries with high fixed costs but low variable costs
  - E.g. DVD player

## Summary

- Dynamic pricing strategy for new products – price changes over time, with the objective of maximizing long term profit

Pricing Strategies:

- Skimming 
- Penetration 
- Understand the market conditions under which the two strategies are optimal
