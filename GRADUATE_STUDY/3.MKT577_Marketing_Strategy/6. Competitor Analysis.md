## What we have learnt last time…

- Customer analysis key for any strategic situation
- Aggregate sales data help you understand overall customer preferences and responsiveness to marketing mix, not by segments
- Customer-level data helps to compare customer characteristics, preferences and responsiveness to marketing mix in different segments
- Primary research can help understand consumer needs and preferences even for new products or marketing promotions
  - A/B testing: implement new ideas quickly, establish causality
  - Survey: use conjoint analysis to measure consumer preferences for bundles of product attributes

## 1. Cross-Elasticities Analysis

- Typical dataset available for marketers – scanner data (**AC Nielson, IRI** etc.)

  - Aggregate store-level data (individual customer shopping data also available)
  - Multiple weeks/months/quarters
  - Multiple categories / brands / SKUs
  - Quantity sales, unit prices, promotional information (features, displays etc.)

- Useful for demand and competition analysis

- See an example for tuna fish category (worksheet “*Data*” at “*Cross-elasticity Data & Result*”)

- For brand *A*, with potential competitors brands *1,2, …, K* in the category

- A typical sales regression model for brand *A* *(see “Data for Regression (Log)”):*

  - $a_A$: Base sales
  - $b_A$: own-price elasticity – percent of sales lift due to 1 percent price cut, **<u>negative</u>** 

  - $b_{1A}$: cross-price elasticity (see next slide)

- **Cross-elasticities**: $b_{1A}, b_{2A}, …,b_{KA}$

  - Positive – percent of sales loss due to 1 percent price cut of brand *k*
  - The larger the cross-elasticities, the closer the substitutability with brand *A –* close competitors
  - With value close to zero (or even –ve.) – no competition relationship
  - Use estimated $b_{1A}, b_{2A}, …,b_{KA}$ to define your competitors

- Cross-elasticities $b_{1A}, b_{2A}, …,b_{KA}$ represent how much your sales will be stolen by price promotion from competitors 

- On the other hand, cross-elasticities $b_{1A}, b_{2A}, …,b_{KA}$ represent how much you can steal sales from your competitors with price promotion

### An Example of Cross-Elasticities Analysis: Tuna Fish

Sales regression difference:

- Not only your price
- Also competitors' prices
- Combine 3 brands together; across 2 stores

### Clout & Vulnerability

- Cross-Price elasticities represent competition capability. Two measures of the capability:

1. *Clout*
   1. How much can price-cuts of my brand steal from my competitors’ brands?
   2. <img src="/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application%20Support/typora-user-images/image-20201021162435435.png" alt="image-20201021162435435" style="zoom:33%;" />



2. *Vulnerability*

   1. How much can price cuts of my competitors’ brands steal from my brand?
   2. <img src="/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application%20Support/typora-user-images/image-20201021162452081.png" alt="image-20201021162452081" style="zoom:33%;" />

   ![image-20201021162646177](/Users/aoyingxue/Library/Application%20Support/typora-user-images/image-20201021162646177.png)

- Why is there a high cross-elasticity between two brands?
  - Customers
  - Products
  - Distribution channels
- For two brands *A* and *B*, what does $b_{AB}>b_{BA}$ imply on price competition strategies?

To decide how aggressive our pricing strategy should be

1. Clout vs. Vulnerability
   1. Make sure you can steal competitors’ customers, and make sure you can retain your customers when they respond

2. Own-price elasticity
   1. Make sure you can have sufficient sales lift when you price promote
3. Profit margin

## Perceptual Map

### What is perceptual map?

- The positioning of brands as consumers perceive them
- The output is a map of product locations in the perceptual space of consumersConsumers may think about a number of attributes in evaluating products. Summarize these attributes because consumer perceptions along these attributes may be correlated
- Two analysis methods
  - Attribute-based: Factor analysis
  - Similarity-based: Multi-Dimensional Scaling
- Details of these statistical methods are covered in *Marketing Research* and *Data Analysis for Brand Management*

### Uses of Perceptual Maps

- Competitive Analysis
  - Understand the competitive market structure as perceived by customers
    - Position relative to competition; select close competitors to compete against 
    - E.g. for Audi, Camry is perceived to be a closer competitor than Volvo
  - Represent customers’ perceptions in a manner that aids communication and discussion within the organization
- Product
  - Perceptions of a new product concept in the context of existing brands in the market
  - Finding the “gap” in the market to position the product
  - E.g. low “prestige” but high “financial effectiveness” space
- Combine with customer analysis to decide <u>targeting</u> and <u>positioning</u> 
- Answer these questions:
  - Which dimensions we are stronger than our competitors?
    - Perceptual map
  - Which segments of customers prefer these dimensions more than the others?
    - Conjoint analysis

### Customer Perception

- Perceptual map has to be constructed based on important attributes customers perceive
  - Objective attributes: price, power, nutrition, convenience… 
  - Subjective attributes: brand image, trendiness, customer service…
- Positions based on how customers perceive the brand or products
- Common mistake: Positioning strategy based on attributes perceived as important by managers, not by customers

> Q: If a brand cuts price, which of the competitor brand below has a stronger incentive to match by also cutting price?
>
> A: A brand with high own-price elasticity, high clout (steal a lot of customers by cutting price), and low vulnerability (other brand cannot steal customers from them if they cut price).
