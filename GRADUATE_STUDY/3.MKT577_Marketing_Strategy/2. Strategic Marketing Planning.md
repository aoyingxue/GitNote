![image-20200921160608929](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1giyyn14flgj30u00i0aci.jpg)

- Match our *strengths* and identified *opportunities*

- Converted into core competencies

  - *Operational excellence*

  - *Product leadership*

  - *Customer loyalty*

> **Amazon**
>
> Strength: big data/ large customer base, customer loyalty, branding
>
> Weakness: quality control (counter and counterfeits), lack of geographical presence (buy instantly without 2-day delivery)
>
> Convert: acquisition of Whole Foods 

## Business-Unit Strategy

- **Strategic Business Unit (SBU)**: A department or team within an organization, with a specialized function and own strategy in alignment with the company's objectives.
  - AWS, Prime xxx, Whole Foods 
- Collection of SBUs represents the product-market portfolio
- Resource allocation
  - Invest and divest strategies

#### **Criteria**

- Consistent with customer needs and positioning strategy
- Evaluate own strengths and competitor weaknesses 
- Explore future opportunities
- Feasible with available resources
- Portfolio balance
  - Synergy and conflicts

### A useful tool for resource allocation: *BCG Matrix* (Boston Consulting Group Matrix)

<u>**Baseline strategy**</u> 

- Combines two important assessments: ***business position* and *market attractiveness*** 
- Includes multiple SBUs: Which to invest and which to divest?
- Provides baseline recommendations serving the introduction of strategic options.

#### 2 dimensions:

1. The **growth** dimension *(market attractiveness)*
   1. Usual mid-point of growth: 10 percent *(high growth market/low)*

2. The **market-share** dimension
   1. Jack Welch: top one or two positions *(strong position)*

##### Example

|                        Stars                         |                Cash Cows                 | Question Mark |                             Dogs                             |
| :--------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|                        (AWS)                         | AWS *(in amazon, they target companies)* |  Prime Music  | Whole Foods *(should look at grocery market broadly, mature industry, what they offer is not totally exclusive)* |
|                        (Echo)                        |         Echo *(industry leader)*         |               |                                                              |
|                                                      |                  Kindle                  |               |                                                              |
|                                                      |              Prime Delivery              |               |                                                              |
| Online retail *(industry increase 10% year by year)* |                                          |               |                                                              |

> How to define business unit? For example, Prime?
>
> - A: Business unit has its own specialized function. So prime video and prime music are different business units.
>
> Why spend so much on Whole Foods?
>
> - Synergy with other business units

#### Investment Decisions

- Cash cows: low investment
  - **Don't invest**. Will generate money and **invest selected question marks**.
- Stars: both users and providers of cash
  - Should be **invested**: room for further expansion is large
- Question marks: requires heavy cash flow. May become a “star” or a “dog.” Use SWOT to decide whether to receive heavy cash inflows or to be sold off.
  - Should be **selective**: like Fire phone, amazon couldn't compete with competitors; for those not selected, should be **divested**.
- Dogs: 
  - Should be **divested**. Not invest.
  - (1) focus strategy to become niche; 
  - (2) milk the business until it dies out; 
  - (3) sold off or liquidated.
- Portfolio balance, synergies and conflicts
- Willing to sacrifice some SBUs for the good of others.

#### Limitations:

- Categorization sensitive to market <u>definition</u> 
- Ignore competitors’ decisions
  - Need to think about how to <u>differentiate</u> from competitors
- Ignore <u>synergies</u> among businesses / spillovers across SBUs
  - Cross-selling and help selling other SBUs
  - "Own your customers"
    - Best serve needs and wants of profitable customers: prime 

#### Subsidization Model:

- Subsidize a business unit by revenue from other units
  - E.g. *Amazon Studios* invested on original series like Mad Dogs, and paid HBO to make select shows available on Prime Instant Video
    - Keep prime members and attract more new members
- When this is a good idea?

### Other Components in Business-Unit Strategy

#### *Goals and objectives*

- Goals: **broad** statement of what the organization wants to achieve *(concepts)*
- Objectives: **specific** statement of what to achieve *(numbers)*
  - Market share, sales revenue, profit etc.
  - Measurable, useful for future evaluation and control

#### *Implementation:* marketing activities

1. Product
   - How do your products differentiate from competitors?
   - Physical and service distinctions

2. Place
   - Distribution channels

3. Price
   - Wholesale and retail prices *(target)* 
   - Loyalty programs

4. Promotion

   - Price promotions

   - Advertising: budget, channels

   - Sales force

#### *Monitoring and Evaluating*

- After the strategy is implemented, may experience many surprises
- Help respond to unexpected events
- Measurements of performance
  - What metrics to use?
  - Quantitative measures
    - ROI, revenue, market share…
      - At the beginning, first 2 years maybe ROI is not a good metric, because of a lot of advertising and input, market share may be a good metric.
- Who are responsible?
- When will it be monitored and evaluated
  - Quarterly, annually, at the end of the planning cycle?
