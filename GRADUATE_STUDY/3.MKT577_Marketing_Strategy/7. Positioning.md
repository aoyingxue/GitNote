## A Theory Model for Positioning

- Competitor and customer perception analyses help deciding positioning 
- Today we will further look at positioning strategy from a theory model
  - Differentiation
  - Standardization
  - What are the drivers?
  - How differentiation changes competitive intensity?

## Model

- Suppose a market with heterogeneous consumers (very different preferences)

- Consumers located along a “Hotelling line” (horizontal differentiation: a type of differentiation)

  > For example, left side customers pay attention to low price, low quality. At the right side, customers care very much at high price and high quality. Each node in between represents one segment and consumers are normally distributed. 

  - Cost of buying from firm A proportional to “perceived” distance => “<u>disutility</u>” of mismatch

  - All consumers willing to pay maximum of $r if matched with ideal perceived position

  - Let r=\$10, mc(cost of goods)=​\$2, “utility cost” for unit distance=\$1

  - Optimal price= \$7, profit = \$30

  - | **Price  A Sets** | **Units  Sold** | **Profits  to A** |
    | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
    | 10                | 1               | 8                 |
    | 9                 | 3               | 21                |
    | 8                 | 5               | 30                |
    | 7                 | 6               | 30                |
    | 6                 | 7               | 28                |
    | 5                 | 8               | 24                |
    | 4                 | 9               | 18                |

- Competitor Firm B: Where does it want to position?
- Suppose Firm B thinks it can squeeze Firm A and positions at X 
  - Firm B sets P = $7, πB = $27.50 and πA = $22.50
  - 3 (niche) customers at extreme right are not served
- Suppose Firm B positions at Y
  - Firm B sets P = \$7, both firms make π = ​\$30
  - Higher profit by differentiating from A
- What else can happen?
- Firm A might respond to B’s positioning strategy by:
  - Fight with lower price
  - Reposition to close to x, thereby squeezing B
  - Introduce a **flanker** brand at y (start a new niche brand at y as its prime brand to flank B)
- Firm B might lose more due to aggressive reaction
- Two effects firms should consider:
  - **<u>Direct Effect</u>** on profits
    - Suppose the **market is sufficiently large**
    - As Firm B moves to the right, it serves more customers and increases profit
  - <u>**Strategic Effect**</u> on profits
    - As Firm B moves to the right, it lessens the threat of price competition and increases profit
- When unfulfilled demand exists, differentiation will
  - Reduces competitive reaction 
  - Leads to higher profits
  - A gap in the perceptual map
- When is demand unfulfilled?
  - Growth market
  - Customer preferences very different

#### Differentiation is the appropriate strategy for positioning when demand is unfulfilled.

## Standardization

- <u>Standardization</u>: the process of creating standards to guide the creation of a good or service based on the consensus of all the relevant parties in the industry
- When you **have cost or other advantages over competitors** and can drive them out!
  - Lower profit in short run but higher monopoly profit in the long run
- When you **have uncertainty about customers**
  - Lack of information on customer preferences
  - High risk to target new and unknown niche segments
  - Better to position similar to proven successful competitors

### The Role of Network Externalities

- “Network externality” among consumers may also lead to standardization
- Network/Peer effects
  - Consumers value the product more with larger installed base
  - E.g. social media (MySpace and Facebook) 
  - E.g. gym / in-home exercise (Peloton)
- Establishing industry standard is important
  - Strategic alliances among ‘competitors’ leads to industry standard - wasteful expenditure in R&D is eliminated
  - Provide clear guidelines for complementary products or services developers
  - Leads to rapid diffusion of the product
  - E.g. Wireless service, VCR/DVD 

### Caveats of Standardization

- Consumer needs are more well-defined over time
- Close firm positions eventually leads to intensified price competition
- Be creative about **value creation**
  - Standardized for measurable product features
  - But create differences in “softer” attributes through marketing
    - Customer support services
    - Customer relationship management 
    - Branding / image

## Me-Too Strategy

- Me-too strategy: common in mature and decline stages of product life cycle when industry has become “commodity”
  - Minimize R&D investments
- Strategies against me-toos:
  - Vertical integration: monopolize valuable resources
  - Signaling, increase capital investments etc. 
  - Establish wide distribution network
  - Marketing activities: Increase customer loyalty, focus on narrower set of consumers but increase penetration

## Lessons Learned

- Positioning strategy
  - Differentiation
    - Better to use when unfulfilled demand exists
    - Serves to reduce price competition and increase profits
  - Standardization
    - Used when 
      - Cost or other advantages over competitors exist
      - Uncertain about customer preferences
      - Network externalities are important
  - Be creative in creating values and differentiate in “soft” attributes through marketing to lessen competition
