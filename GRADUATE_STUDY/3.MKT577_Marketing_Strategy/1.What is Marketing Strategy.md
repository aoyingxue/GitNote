## What is Strategy?

- A plan of actions / activities that involves resource allocation
  - Resources are **costly**, limited budget
  - Constant trade-offs required
  - Usually with long-term impacts and costly to change

- Marketing actions are not independent

- Requires an *integrated marketing plan*

  - 4Ps (work together and enhance your position)

- Key considerations:

  - 3Cs
    - **Who are our customers? What do they want? How we match their needs?** 
    - Who are competitors? What are they good at? 
    - What are we good at? 
    - What’s around the corner? What’s new there?

- Traditional view: *operational effectiveness*

  - Create and deliver better value

  - Maintain lower costs

    => Increase **transactional value** (willingness-to-pay - cost)

  These are parts of business strategy, but NOT ALL!

- Performing **different** activities from rivals’ or performing similar activities in different ways (M. Porter): <u>DIFFERENTIATION</u> IS IMPORTANT

  - Similar activities in different ways: same service but different promotion to position your brand differently

  > Main trade-off: 
  >
  > - Choose b or c: 
  >   - Benefit: straightly dominates your competitor; maximize market share quickly
  >   - **competitor will respond** and go into a pricing war, or improve efficiency, they would improve and then go into a strategic conversion, competition will intensify
  > - Choose A:
  >   - Competitors still have C consumers; we differentiate with our competitor and reduce competitive pressure

Therefore strategy also includes (M. Porter):

- The creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities

How to guarantee that competitors cannot imitate by either *repositioning* or *straddling*?

- Maintaining a *sustainable strategic position / sustainable competitive advantage* 

Strategy from a **marketer’s** perspective:

- What is the biggest sustainable competitive advantage for a firm?
  - **Customers** 
    - Loyalty, switching cost

- What is the biggest differentiation from competitors?
  - **Customers** 
    - If your loyal customers are different from competitors
