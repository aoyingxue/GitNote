### 1(a)

From margin arithmetic 1 and 2, we could know that if we want the profit to stay unchanged, given: e=-3, r = 0.05, quantity demanded have to go up to m/(m-r)q0=m/(m-0.05)q0 to leave profits unchanged and quantity demanded will go up because of the price cut to (1–ε *r)*q0=1.6q0. These two numbers need to match so that m=0.53. 

### 1(b)

Same as 1(a), given e=-3, m=0.53, using the same equation q1 /q0 =m/(m-r)=1–ε *r to make the profit unchanged, we could know that maximum percentage price cut is 20%. 

### 1(c)

<u>Optimal Price</u>: **p\* = [ε / (ε + 1)] c** =\$1.875 

### 1(d)

I think if the main goal is to introduce a second brand and increase the sales of the new brand, we should raise the price of the ACTIVE. Because from the scan pro model and that the two brands are substitutes, we can know that if we raise price of one brand, consumers will buy less of the brand and more of the new brand to substitute the need, which could bring more sales to the new brand HIGH ENERGY. 

### 2(a)

Advertising elasticity of the perfume brand is 0.1028, which means that if the brand increases the advertising exposure by 1%, the weekly sales will increase by 0.1028%. 

### 2(b)

Advertising elasticity = 0.1028. Price elasticity = -2.6345. The optimal advertising is 0.1028/2.6345=0.03902069 or 3.90% of sales. So the optimal advertising spending is 0.039*\$4245500=\$165662.33.  

### 2(c)

If calculating infinite carryover effect, the average constant ratio is 0.78356057 and thus the total price elasticity is 0.1852/(1-0.78356057)=0.8557. 

### 2(d)

The Dorfman-Steiner allocation of advertising is 0.335 or 33.5% of sales, approximately as much as \$1421701.88. It's much higher than 2(b). But we should trust the answer in this question. Because advertising effects have carryover effect. As memory decays, the sales will decrease but will not wear out suddenly. The elasticity in 2(a) is only an immediate-term effect of advertising. We need 2(d) result to show the effect in a current period. So 2(d) is more accurate. 

### 3

The off-invoice trade deal means that retailer gets discount on units bought from manufacturer. The scan-back trade deal means that retailer gets discount on units sold to end-consumers. 

Retailers prefer off-invoice because they could buy extra units during the trade deal and then divert the units to other retailers. They could charge a higher price to those retailers and then get a profit from it. 

Brand managers of the manufacturers could increase deal depth or increase deal time length of the scan-back trade deal to align the incentives of the retailers.

By increasing deal depth, the brand managers' profit strictly increases because forward buying is eliminated, but the retailer also agrees to accept the trade deal because it's a better deal with maybe even lower costs than off-invoice. 

### 4(a)

Given that the profit contribution per conversion is \$600, the conversion rate is 0.45% and the total daily searches are 22500, we could get that the total daily profit obtained by keyword would be \$60750. Intuitively to make the bid at least profitable, and conservatively, we can only bid for no more than PC\*CR\*50%=\$1.35. 

### 4(b)

Percentage increase in click-through rates is 0.4495. Percentage increase in prices per click is 0.1608. Apparently click-through-rate increases at a much faster rate. So it turns out that 0.4495/(0.4495+0.1608)>0.5, which means that the optimal bid would be higher than the conservative one. 

### 4(c)

The optimal bid =600\*0.45%\*0.4495/(0.4495+0.1608)= \$1.99. Using the price response function, we could get ln(1.99)=1.0505-0.1608*rank, rank=2.25786109, which means that he could obtain as high as rank 2 for such a bid. 

### 4(d)

CTR=exp(-1.5610-0.4495*2)=0.08543495. 

Number of conversions=CTR*total daily searches\*conversion rate=8.65028879.

Acquisition costs per conversion=CPC/conversion rate=441.913813

Transactional profit=(profit contribution per conversion-acquisition costs per conversion)\*number of conversions=(600-441.913813)*8.65028879=1367.49.
