## 6.1: Sales Force Strategy

### Advertising versus Distribution

- Advertising is about making people aware that there exists the product that was made to cater to them.
- Distribution is about delivering products to people when / where they want them.

Both are key support functions, but secondary to value creation.

### Sales Force Strategy Issues

Resource allocation is what we're going to talk about here.

### Sales Force Allocation

- Firms set sales force SF
- Form of profit: **Market response model**

- If we understand the Sales function, we can solve for best SF level.
- If SF={SFproduct1,SFproduct2,SFproduct3...}, we can solve for best allocation of sales force to products.

## AdBudg Model for Salesforce Allocation

> The <u>historical</u> data doesn't provide us enough variation. We cannot use historical data. 

- Measure market response to sales force.
- Two Halves
  - <u>**Judgment**</u> Data
    - Structured **survey** among managers to harvest their collective wisdom about market responsiveness.
  - Quantifiable Model
    - Puts equation to soft data to quantify market response.
- Advantages
  - Very useful in scenarios with no data
  - Quick
  - Builds consensus
  - Encourages systematic thinking (forward looking) 
  - Cheap!

## AdBudg Survey

### Question 

 What do you expect the sales level (relative to current levels) to be in response to

- No sales force
  -  even if there's no salesforce, they will continue to buy the product because the relationship built for years or decades
- 50% of current sales force
- ~~100% of current sales force~~ (not included in the survey, it's obvious because it's 100%, but we need to consider)
- 150% of current sales force
- Saturation level sales force

### Implementation

Answering these questions is usually done by forcing a consensus estimate from a team of managers.

- All members of the team first answer the questions privately.
- Results are revealed and discussed.
- Adjustments are made and discussed until a single set of answers to 5 questions remains.

### Delphi method

#### Key assumption

Forecasts from a structured group of experts are more accurate than those from unstructured groups or individuals.

## The AdBudg Approach

### Example Data from Elicitation

- **Saturation** level of salesforce: Under no circumstances will our sales go beyond 160% of our current sales, or 1.6 times our current sales.

### Fit an S Curve to these Points

### Estimate c and d

### Calculate Profit for a Proposed SF

- Take proposed SF.
- Convert to a multiple of current SF (e.g., 1.4).
- Use AdBudg to predict multiple of current Sales. 
- Convert predicted multiple to \$ Sales.
- Convert ​\$ Sales to ​\$ Profit.  
  - Compare to present, should hire more? 



> Q: How frequently should a company do the adbudg model?
>
> Every year. Because it involves hiring and firing people.
