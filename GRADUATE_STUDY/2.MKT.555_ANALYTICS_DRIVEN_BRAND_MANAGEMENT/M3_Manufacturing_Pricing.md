## Manufacturer Pricing Problem

**<u>Assumption</u>**: the price elasticity for consumers or retailers is the same.

So the retailer buys Dannon at roughly \$0.44 from the manufacturer and resells Dannon to the end consumer at roughly \$0.57, so thus making a unit profit of about ​\$0.14 or ​\$0.13 per tub of yogurt.

**Total profit = retail profit + manufacturer profit** 

> that's fairly typical in most product categories. Because the retailer has the luxury of dealing directly with the end consumers, In many categories, they take a disproportionate share of the distribution channel profit.So the total profit in the distribution channel is the sum of those two numbers. So that's roughly $40. 

Manufacturer also uses markup rule to calculate. For all manufacturers who sell only one product, they can use markup rule without compromise.

But for retailers, they may sell multiple products at the same time so markup rule sometimes won't work. 

### Double marginalization <u>problem</u>

> It's a <u>problem</u> in the sense that the presence of the retailer makes the product more expensive to the end consumer, and furthermore, it hurts the product manufacturer severely in terms of reducing their profit. 

- The manufacturer marks up his or her cost to arrive at an optimal wholesale price. 
- And the retailer marks that up one more time to arrive at his retail place. 
- 2 times to apply a margin to the cost (manufacturer)

### What if Dannon set up her own store?

In this <u>direct selling</u> arrangement, Dannon alone is making $54. So the total distribution channel profit has increased, Dannon's profit has <u>tripled</u>, and <u>consumers</u> are paying a <u>lower</u> price, as well. 

### Then why not direct selling?

- the whole idea of retail stores is to <u>make shopping easy</u>. So it's not terribly practical. 
  - Because of that, it won't be the same elasticity at Dannon's store as Schnucks
- <u>additional costs</u> that Dannon would incur in setting up these Dannon stores, which would more than wipe away the extra profits that we have computed here. 
- So the logistical costs associated with selling directly in this case are prohibitive. So therefore, we cannot reach this kind of profit once you account for those extra costs.

### Difference 

#### Multi-product retailer

- Retailer must set two <u>**retailer prices**</u> for 2 products, it's a <u>multiple product</u> problem, and optimal mark-up rule doesn't apply. 
- the retailer must use the principles of the previous module: go to <u>Solver</u> and maximize the profit in order to determine the optimal retail prices

#### Manufacturer competition

- When considering **<u>wholesale prices</u>**, they have to consider their competitor.
