## Individual Assignment 2

1. After constructing the table in excel, we could know we should set Jif as \$0.701, Skippy as \$0.703, and Peter Pan as \$0.674. The resulting profits in the category is 38.433. Brand Skippy accounts for the greatest share of the retail profit.

2. The profit of Peter Pan is \$10.198, while the retail profit is \$9.810. The brand profit as a manufacturer is larger than Clayton Schnucks obtains from the brand.

3. We should set the wholesale price as \$0.476. The resulting profit is \$11.22. It's 10.025% higher than the profit calculated in Q2.

4. After running 3 regressions on each brand, we could figure out in the end the wholesale price would constitute a Nash equilibrium and ends up with \$0.488 for Jif, \$0.513 for Skippy and \$0.476 for Peter Pan.
