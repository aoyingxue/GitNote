## What are trade promotions?

- Trade promotions are incentives directed toward other members of the distribution channel.
- Trade promotions account for over 60% of manufacturer marketing budgets in packaged goods (> $75B).
- There is a heated debate between manufacturers and retailers over the effectiveness of these promotions.

- Wholesaler sometimes is owned by the manufacturer. 

### Retail Pass-through of Trade Deal

## Lack-of- pass-through problem

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdrhped918j30lu0h2n3a.jpg" alt="image-20200412121945803" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Ideal pass-through

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdri041epaj30pi0guwhc.jpg" alt="image-20200412123002902" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Real pass-through

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdri0mfsjgj30p60h4mzg.jpg" alt="image-20200412123029585" style="zoom:50%;" />

## How to estimate pass-through?

- First, they run two models to understand the relationship between the price paid by the retailers and the price paid by wholesaler.  

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdri1o75b5j30pk0camz7.jpg" alt="image-20200412123132718" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Estimated pass-through elasticities

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdri2jmed4j30nq0cwmyg.jpg" alt="image-20200412123222906" style="zoom:50%;" />

If the wholesaler gives the retailer a 10% off trade deal, that becomes a 5.9% off discount to the end consumer. 

if a manufacturer gives a 10% off trade deal to the wholesaler, that eventually becomes a 4.1% off to the end consumer all the way downstream in the distribution channel.

So less than half of the trade promotional monies find their way to the consumers' pockets. The rest is pocketed in the distribution channel, some by wholesaler and the rest by retailer. Mostly by retailers. 

## Profitability of Trade Promotions

In this picture is shown 250 products across more than 1,000 stores in terms of how profitable trade deals on these products at those stores were to the manufacturer and wholesaler

- As long as that pass- through is high, that pass-through elasticity is high, and the product's price elasticity at the store is also high, the trade deal is highly profitable.
- The **product** must be **price elastic** enough 
- there must be **sufficient pass-through**. 
  - It's not enough for just one of the two to happen, in fact. There should be sufficient price elasticity and sufficient pass-through for a trade deal to eventually become profitable to the manufacturer

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdrn17p0q1j30li0hw0xo.jpg" alt="image-20200412152405223" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Get rid of trade deals on all these products at all those stores that occupy the southeast corner of this picture.
- that led to the manufacturer dropping trade deals to the tune of 56%, so they retained only 44% of trade deals compared to the previous year.
- on a net basis, trade deals would, in fact, payoff. So this ended up improving the profitability of trade deals for this CPG manufacturer by 86%. 

### Conclusion

- A large proportion of trade promotions does not reach consumers.
- On average, a 10 % promotion from the manufacturer results in a 4.1 % promotion for the consumer.
- Up to 56 % of trade promotions may be unprofitable.
- **Recommendation**: Offer trade deals when demand is **elastic** and **channel members cooperate** (i.e., pass-through).
- About trade deals:
  - **Large manufacturers** tend to get more pass-through from retailers. 
  - **High market share products** tend to get more retailer pass-through.
  - Wholesalers tend to give more pass-through to **large retailers**.
  - **15%** of retail promotions at stores happen with NO manufacturer trade deals triggering them. 
    - Retail stores offer these retail promotions, or discounts, to consumers completely on their own with **no incentives** from manufacturers or wholesalers. 

## Trade Promotional Planning

### Two Types of Trade Promotions

1. **Off-Invoice**: Retailer gets discount on **units bought** from manufacturer.

   1. Brand managers suffer since **retailers forward-buy**.
      1. **Diverting**: the retailer would buy extra units during the trade deal and then divert these units, or at least a partial number of these units, to other retailers. And while doing this, the retailer would charge a higher price to those retailers. (Buy from manufacturers, becomes a reseller to other retailers)

2. **Scan-Back**: Retailer gets discount on **units sold** to end-consumers.

   1. Brand managers prefer this since it eliminates forward-buying.

      1. In many markets, the retailers had more clout, or power, than manufacturer's. Most manufacturers are small compared to large retailers like Walmart and Kroger

      2. manufacturers align the incentives of the retailers by 

         increasing the depth of the trade deal:
         
         1. in doing that, the brand managers' profit strictly increased because forward buying was eliminated, but the retailer also agreed to accept the trade deal. 
         
         <img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdrod9osqyj30la0c4753.jpg" alt="image-20200412161017070" style="zoom:40%;" />
         
         increasing the time length of the trade deal:
         
         2. So now the retailer is choosing between offering, or accepting, a trade deal under off-invoice terms at 40% off, but valid only during week 6 versus scan-back at 40% off, but valid over week 6 and 7. So this was another way of making the retailers' incentives align with the manufacturers, but at the same time, strictly making the manufacturer better off compared to the off-invoice arrangement.

3. <u>Lump sum payment</u>: Manufacturers pay retailers for store displays and newspaper features 
   
   1. *“Local” advertising*
4. <u>Slotting allowance</u>: Manufacturers pay retailers for <u>retail shelf footage</u> (new products)
   
1. *Kroger charges Unilever $100 per linear foot*
   
5. <u>Quantity discount</u>: Manufacturers give retailers price discounts on large orders
   1. *Milk is cheaper at Wal-Mart than at CVS!*
      1. Why?
         1. <u>Convenience</u>: CVS knows that the shopping experience is more convenient at their store, where it's more time consuming at Walmart.  So for that, they charge a price premium. 
         2. <u>Costly</u> for CVS: Walmart buys in bulk from the manufacturer on the basis of which it gets these quantity discounts.

#### Price discrimination/Segmented pricing (offering off-invoice)

<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gdrnrtsckyj30qm05aq5e.jpg" alt="image-20200412154940795" style="zoom:50%;" />

- a large segment of consumers whose willingness to pay for that product is less than $2, so they find the price to be not low enough, and they choose not to buy this manufacturer's brand at that store. 
- Manufacturer reduces that wholesale price and simply charge \$1, instead, as the wholesale price to the retailer, knowing that the retailer will perhaps mark that price up to ​\$1.5 at the store, at which price those additional consumers would buy.
- But in going after these new consumers with that lower price, the manufacturer lose $0.50 with all of those buyers who are willing to pay that higher price for their brand.
- By offering this discount temporarily for one week, the manufacturer can hope to get these buyers who are currently not buying their brand. But lose the $0.50 profit margin on all of those other buyers who are currently buying their brand, but just for week 6. 
- For the remaining weeks, they're going to pay that higher price, so therefore in the long run, for at least 12 of those 13 weeks, the manufacturer doesn't lose in terms of subsidizing the profit margin on the existing buyers.
- **The manufacturer is reaching two segments of consumers with two different prices** 

##### Problems:

1. lack of pass-through: the retailer can choose not to pass-through the trade deal. So could be a problem. 
2. Factory Shipments Plot:
   1. during discounts, the retailer is buying a lot, and in other periods the retailer is buying way less than usual.

### Distribution Channel Issues

1. Incentives of Manufacturers and Retailers are not always aligned.
   1. Retailer could offer price promotion unilaterally! (Without manufacturers giving incentives)
      1. the retailer is stuck with excess inventory and wants to dispose of them.
      2. A more practical reason that is observed more commonly is that the retailer is using the manufacturer's brand as a loss leader, in other words, to get foot traffic to their store.
   2. This may hurt **brand equity**!

2. Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) was illegal until 2007! • 3. Medical Giveaways raise ethical concerns.
