## Price Elasticity of Demand

> When I say demand, I mean sales, specifically unit sales. I will use these terms interchangeably, demand and sales. Dollar sales will be referred to as revenues, so when I do not qualify the word and simply say sales, remember, it refers to unit sales, which is the same as demand. 

### Price Elasticity of Demand (Œµ)

- Œµ= % change in demand for a 1% change in price
- **Œµ= [(q1 - q0) / q0] / [(p1 - p0) / p0]** 
  - Current price of your brand is P0, and the current sales, or the current demand, for your brand is Q0
- (p0, q0) = original price, original demand
- (p1, q1) = changed price, changed demand
- (p1 - p0) / p0: percentage change in price
- (q1 - q0) / q0: percentage change in demand

### Points to Remember

- Œµ must be negative

- Price Elasticity must be <u>negative</u> (< 0) 
- -1 < Œµ < 0 implies <u>inelastic</u> demand (hardly unusual)
- Œµ < -1 implies <u>elastic</u> demand 

### Drivers of Price Elasticity

- Availability of substitutes 
  - More substitutes, more price elasticity
  - The more substitutes a brand has, the more price elastic its demand would be. 
  - If a brand with many substitutes were to increase its price, consumers can easily switch to one of the remaining brands.
- Extent of substitutability (degree)
  - Each of them has one main substitute. But in terms of the second driver, the two brands are quite different. I would argue that Yoplait faces a more substitutable competitor than does Campbell Soup. In other words, Progresso is not as substitutable for Campbell as Dannon is substitutable for Yoplait. So according to the second driver, even if two brands were to have the same number of substitutes, if one brand faces greater degree of substitutability, greater extent of substitutability with its competitor, then you would expect that brand to be more price elastic. 
- Awareness of prices
  - between two brands which have the same number of substitutes and which also face the same degree of substitutability with those substitutes, if one brand is in a product category where consumers are simply more aware of prices, then that brand is expected to be more price elastic. If consumers are generally less aware of prices, then that would make all brands in that category less price elastic.

## Margin Arithmetic - 1 (predict)

<u>How much does demand change when price is cut by r?</u> üåü

- <u>p1 =(1-r)p0</u> (question)
- What is q1?
- Answer 
  - Œµ=[(q1-q0)/q0]/[(p1‚Äìp0)/p0] 
  - Œµ=[(q0‚Äìq1)/q0]/[(p0‚Äìp1)/p0] 
  - Œµ=[(q0‚Äìq1)/q0]/r 
  - Œµr=[(q0‚Äìq1)/q0]
  - Œµr=1-(q1/q0) 
  - q1/q0=1-er 
  - **<u>q1=(1-er)q0</u>** (answer)

## Margin Arithmetic - 2 (Breakeven formula)

<u>Price elasticity is useful to predict changes in quantity demanded from a price cut:</u> 

- Question: <u>p1 =(1-r)p0</u>
- Answer: **q1 =(1-Œµr)q0** (Margin Arithmetic - 1)

<u>How much does quantity demanded have to go up to leave profits unchanged?</u> üåü

$\pi_1$ =q1(p1 -c), and $\pi_0$ =q0(p0 -c)

We want $p1 = p0$, so q1 /q0 = (p0 -c)/(p1 -c)

Since <u>p1 = (1-r) p0</u>, 
**q1 /q0 =m/(m-r)** (changed sales divided by original sales must be at least as large as that right-hand side.)
where price margin m=(p0 ‚Äìc)/p0 (**percentage margin**)

### <u>What is the key implication of this formula?</u>

- Larger the price cut, more the sales must expand to rationalize that price cut in profit terms.
  - For a given profit margin, as the price cut increases and the right-hand side of the formula increases, which means a larger expansion in sales would be called for to make that price cut profitable.
- As the profit margin of the brand decreases, sales has to expand even more to make a price cut profitable. 
  - For a given percentage price cut, as the profit margin of a brand increases, the right-hand side of the formula decreases, so therefore, a smaller sales expansion is necessary to keep the price cut profitable.

### % Change in Profit

#### 25% margin line (M=0.25)

- on the x-axis is the price elasticity of your brand
- the <u>less price elastic</u> your brand, the <u>less profitable</u> a 5% price cut would be
- intersection:
  - if your brand's price elasticity is at least as large as -5, by that we mean it's -5 or even larger than that, -5.5 or -6. By larger, I'm referring to the <u>magnitude</u>, remember that. If it's at least as price elastic as that, then this price cut will be profitable. Else, this price cut will be unprofitable because we are below the 0 line. 

#### 50% margin line (M=0.5)

- It would always be above 25% margin line
- The <u>higher the profit margin</u> of your brand, the <u>more profitable</u> a price cut of 5% would be, and this is true regardless of what your brand's price elasticity is. 
- a given price cut would be more profitable for a brand of a given price elasticity if its profit margin were higher. 

Grocery products or brands sold in supermarket stores typically have price elasticities between -2 and -5. M=15%

## Optimal Mark-Up Rule (most important)

<u>Optimal Price</u>: **p\* = [Œµ / (Œµ + 1)] c** 

<u>Profit maximizing price</u> 

- c: marginal cost of producing your brand; how much it costs to produce your brand
- Œµ: Price elasticity

### <u>What is the implication of this formula?</u>

1. **Higher** the <u>cost</u>, **higher** the <u>optimal price</u>.
2. **More** <u>price elastic</u> the product, **lower** the <u>optimal price</u>.
   1. It's going to c
   2. An extremely price elastic brand can charge an optimal price equal to the cost of production, which means it cannot make any profit

## Reservation Price (WTP)

- Price below which consumer will buy the product
- Also called ‚ÄúWillingness to Pay‚Äù (WTP)
- Different across consumers

### Demand Curve

- Determined by the distribution of WTP across consumers in the market.
- Demand curve is **downward**-sloping!

### Inverse Demand Curve

- Plot of brand‚Äôs quantity demanded versus price
- ![image-20200323121439061](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTgy1gd4d5xj29sj30cq09w74l.jpg)
- Also called "<u>Sales response curve</u>"

#### Estimating Demand Curve

- Estimate relationship between sales and prices using historical data.
- Why not just ask consumers their WTP‚Äôs?
  - "Stated Preferences ‚â† Revealed Preferences":
    - What consumers say may not mirror what consumers do. 
      - Consumers might willy nilly overstate their willingness to pay for your brand, saying what's the cost of my saying I'm willing to pay more? After all, I'm not being asked to buy the product here
      - they might systematically understate their willingness to pay, thinking, well, the researcher is going to communicate the results of this survey to the product manufacturer, so if I state a lower willingness to pay, perhaps they will charge a lower price for this product.

- $\alpha$ : baseline sales; brand equity
  - EXP of alpha represents the sales that your brand would obtain at a price of $1. 
  - higher the alpha, the farther out this curve will be. Lower the alpha, the nearer to the origin this curve will be. 
- $\beta$ : curvature of the curve; Price Elasticity of Your Brand
  - higher the value of beta, the shallower this curve will be. Lower the value of beta, steeper this curve will be.

- Horizontal seperation 
  - the additional sales the red brand would get compared to the blue brand at a price of \$xx. 
- Vertical seperation
  - to sell the same number of units, the red brand need not cut price as much as the blue brand. It can charge a price premium of \$xx over the blue brand in order to sell the same number of units as the blue brand.

### Compare 2 brands in one store

If the price of Maxwell House in Store A was \$1, and the price of Folgers in Store A was ‚Äã\$1, whichever Q is larger is the stronger brand.

###### Which has the better price elasticity in store A? (Own-price elasticity)

By greater, it should be the magnitude. Compare two own price elasticities absolute value. (1.14<1.25, F is more price elastic)

###### Which brand is more vulnerable to the other? (Cross price elasticity)

F 0.59> M 0.37

Maxwell hurts Folgers more than Folgers hurts Maxwell. So Folgers is more vulnerable. 

From Margin Arithmetic - 3: Higher the price elasticity, lower the optimal price that can be charged. So Folgers must charge a lower price than Maxwell House. 

## Scan*Pro Model

- Multiplicative Model
- Constant Elasticity Model
- Use the Optimal Mark-Up Rule to Set Price

## Lab

1. The price elasticity of a brand (estimated using historical brand sales data) is - 2.3. The brand‚Äôs current price is \$3 and it sells 1 million units at that price. How many additional units will it sell if it cut its price to ‚Äã\$2.5?

   > r=0.5/3=0.1667
   >
   > Increase by 2.3*0.1667=0.3833 million

2. The current profit margin of the above brand (at its current price of $3) is 30 %. If the brand offers a price cut of 10 %, how many additional units must the brand sell at this reduced price in order to make the price cut profitable?

   > Q1/q0=[30%/(30%-10%)]=1.5M
   >
   > q0=1M
   >
   > q1=1.5-1=0.5 million

3. What is the optimal (i.e., profit maximizing) price for the above brand?

   > $\epsilon=-2.3$
   >
   > (3-c)/3=0.3 
   >
   > c=2.1
   >
   > m=(p-c)/p
   >
   > p=3.72

4. Suppose brand X has a price elasticity of -3 and brand Y has a price elasticity of -5. Suppose that they both currently sell 1m units per week at their current prices. For a 20 % price cut, which of the two brands will experience a larger increase in units sold? How about for a 30 % price cut? How about for a 40 % price cut? Explain the differences (if any) between the three answers.

   > Y, Y, Y
   >
   > More price elastic

5. Which of the above two brands will have a higher optimal (i.e., profit-maximizing) price (assuming that their costs of production are identical and equal to $1 per unit)?

   > X
   >
   > Price elasticity increases, optimal price decreases

6. Suppose that both of the above brands are priced at their optimal values (as calculated above). Which one will experience a larger increase in profit from a 20 % price cut? Why?

   > Neither brand will increase. Price is already optimal. It's profit maximizing. Any change in price will decrease the profit. 

- Optimal Mark-Up for Maxwell House in Store A? 
  - $\epsilon_{MA}=-1.14$ 
  - $P_{MA}=8.14$ (Markup)
- Optimal Mark-Up for Folgers in Store A?
  - $P_{FA}=5$ (Markup)
- Optimal Mark-Up for Maxwell House in Store B? 
  - $\epsilon_{MB}=-1.14$ 
  - $P_{FB}=5$ (Markup)
- Optimal Mark-Up for Folgers in Store B?

#### Why need cross price elasticity when seeming like we only need own price elasticity?

Optimally, in order to correctly estimate the own price elasticity, you have to use cross price elasticity

Cross price elasticity will be used directly to price the products in store if you are a retailer.
