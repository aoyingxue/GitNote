Group homework 1

Don't scale every variable. Those which really stand out (larger than double...) and not the dummy variables. But scale or not, the accuracy of the prediction won't be affected. Putting them on the same scale is for interpreting the coefficients of different variables. 

For dummy variables, 0-1 variation. To scale using 1 sd, it means how likely to observe the variation jumping from -1sd to 1sd. 

To lift the first bar as high as possible and as differentiated as possible. 

Logistic regression: more factors and info (if logit only use RFM three variables, it would get the same performance as RFM)

RFM: less information
