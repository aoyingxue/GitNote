2. Pentathlon should adopt 2-email per week frequency because the LTV for 2-per-week is the highest among the four conditions. 

3. I would recommend 1-email per week frequency because even though the LTV for now is quite low for 1-email per week option, however, for long term it has the highest probability of customers being active among 4 options, which means it could maintain much more customers comparing to other 3.

4. Firstly, subscribe attrition rate and customer's churn rate are crossing each other and the revenue of unsubscribed customers which is simply averaged among the customers who unsubscribed but didn't churned and who churned is quite unclear. Best if separating these two groups of customers and add a row with real churn rate. 

   Secondly, with different product lines, the best frequency is different. If the company needs to determine a best frequency of emails, they should  do an experiment for each of the 7 products and then look at the average frequency.
