- People put too much weight on **own** experience, values
  - *"Most people are like me."*
- People have **poor intuitive sense**s for how much information about the market deliver can deliver in value (in $) *<u>overconfident</u>*
  - Marketing research can inform more than just “biggest decision”
- People are limited and biased information processors
  - Availability bias
  - Confirmation bias
  - Sunk cost bias
- !!! While using only **intuition** can lead you astray, <u>blindly following models</u> can lead to even more disastrous results. 

## V. What is the solution?

- Use both market **research tools and judgment**
  - If both agree, make decision and move on
  - If disagreement, think hard about **why** that is
- Even if use judgment-based quantification, use **framework** to help **overcome these biases**
- Key – gives best chance to make right decision
  - Must make decisions
  - Use best information of firm
  - **No one can guarantee success**

- Research is valuable if it is
  - **Relevant** to decision
  - **Timely** 
  - **Accurate**
  - **Cost** **effective**
